# InterviewsStatistics (Discussion Analyzer)This project analyzes discussions and generates statistical summaries and visualizations based on the content.## Code Structure- `discussion_analyzer.py`: Main script that orchestrates the analysis process.- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for input/output paths and analysis settings.- `code/sub/`:  - `file_processing.py`: Handles reading discussion files.  - `analysis1.py`: Performs initial analysis on discussions.  - `analysis2.py`: Conducts statistical analysis including ANOVA, Tukey's HSD, and mixed-effects modeling.  - `charts.py`: Generates visualizations based on the analysis results.## Statistical AnalysesThe project performs the following statistical analyses:1. Summary Statistics: Calculates mean and variance for Tech_Score, Ethics_Score, and Edu_Score for each persona.2. One-way ANOVA: Analyzes the variance between different personas for each score.3. Tukey's HSD Test: Conducts pairwise comparisons between personas for each score.4. Mixed-effects Model: Fits a model treating personas as random effects for each score.## Visualizations- Bar chart showing Mean Tech Score for all personas, ordered from highest to lowest.## Usage1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.2. Update the `config.yaml` file with appropriate input and output paths.3. Run `discussion_analyzer.py` to perform the analysis and generate results.## Output- `comprehensive_analysis_summary.csv`: Contains all statistical analysis results.- `tech_score_chart.png`: Bar chart visualization of Mean Tech Scores.

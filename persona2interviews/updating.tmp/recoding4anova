1) Creation of a data object  for high/low education and high/low tech score

Consider the following data objects

res_low_filtered
res_high_filtered

head(res_low_filtered[3:6])
                           Persona Iteration Maverick Tech_Score
1 restaurant_manager_interview.txt         1        0 0.01046207
2 restaurant_manager_interview.txt         2        0 0.01062699
3 restaurant_manager_interview.txt         3        0 0.01283422
4         geneticist_interview.txt         1        0 0.01801802
5         geneticist_interview.txt         2        0 0.01968504
6         geneticist_interview.txt         3        0 0.02315325

The structure for res_high_filtered is the same
Ignore the column maverick


The task: Transform these two objects into a new data object


The resulting data object should be in long format with 3 columns or variable
Var1: Above_LLM with scores 1 and 0
Var2: Edu with score 2 and 0
Var3: Tech_Score with scores gleaned directly from 

For Var1 the Tech_Score of both res_high_filtered and res_low_filtered
have to be considered. If the Tech_Score equals 0.017372, Var1 should be code with 1, otherise Var1 should be be coded with 0

For Var2, the origin of the Tech_Score determines the coding. If the Tech_Score comes from res_high_filtered, code Var2 with 2. If the Tech_Score comes from res_low_filtered, code Var2 with 0



2) Task: Creation of a data object  for high/low education and 5/10/20 years of coding experience  

Consider the following data objects

res_5y_filtered
res_10y_filtered
res_20y_filtered


> head(res_5y_filtered)
             Persona Iteration Tech_Score
1 Restaurant Manager         1 0.02125693
2 Restaurant Manager         2 0.02014652
3 Restaurant Manager         3 0.01094527
4         Geneticist         1 0.01702933
5         Geneticist         2 0.03055556
6         Geneticist         3 0.02962298
Etc.

The structure for res_10y_filtered and res_20y_filtered
is the same



Consider also the following data objects

res_high_filtered, res_low_filtered



> head(res_high_filtered[3:6])
                           Persona Iteration Maverick Tech_Score
1 restaurant_manager_interview.txt         1        0 0.01348921
2 restaurant_manager_interview.txt         2        0 0.02349336
3 restaurant_manager_interview.txt         3        0 0.01287208
4         geneticist_interview.txt         1        0 0.02374429
5         geneticist_interview.txt         2        0 0.01966292
6         geneticist_interview.txt         3        0 0.02105263




The task: Transform exactly these objects (and not self-created objects!) into a new data object to e called "ANOVA_Coding*EDU"


The resulting data object should be in long format with 4 columns or variables
Var1: Persona
Var2: Coding with scores 5,10, 20
Var3: Edu with score 2 and 0
Var4: Tech_Score 

For Var2, the Tech_Scores of res_coding_5y, res_coding_10y and res_coding_20y
have to be considered. 

For Var3, the origin of the Tech_Score determines the coding. If the Tech_Score comes from res_high_filtered, code Var2 with 2. If the Tech_Score comes from res_low_filtered, code Var2 with 0

As a test consider the following:

For every persona, there should be 3 * 3 (5, 10 20 years) * 2 (high, low education) = 18 rows in the resulting data object. 




--------------------------------------
Lets start a new project which I like to call meta-insights. I have developed a method of person prompting described in the two readme files. I also send you the representation format for persona used in persona prompting

expert,role,background,gender,age,hobbies,style,education_level,years_of_coding_experience
Journalist specialised on Technology,moderator, NA, NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
NA,participant,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Note that the persona "Journalist" is the interviewer. Here is the question for you:

Which persona specification would lead to the best interview answers. Which job should this persona have which background etc.

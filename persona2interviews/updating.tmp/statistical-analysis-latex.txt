\subsection{Statistical Analysis of Persona Features}

To analyze the contribution of various persona features to the tech, education, and ethics scores, we employ the following statistical approach:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Preparation:} We create multiple variations for each persona, ensuring a balanced design and appropriate coding of categorical variables.

    \item \textbf{Statistical Design:} We utilize Multiple Linear Regression models, with separate models for tech, education, and ethics scores.

    \item \textbf{Model Specification:}
    \begin{equation}
        Score_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + ... + \beta_k X_{ki} + \epsilon_i
    \end{equation}
    where $Score_i$ represents the tech, education, or ethics score for the $i$-th observation, $X_{ki}$ are the persona features, and $\epsilon_i$ is the error term.

    \item \textbf{Feature Importance:} We assess feature importance using standardized coefficients and LASSO regression for feature selection.

    \item \textbf{Model Diagnostics:} We check for linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

    \item \textbf{Cross-validation:} We employ k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and generalizability.

    \item \textbf{Effect Size Assessment:} We use standardized coefficients (beta coefficients) and partial R-squared values to compare effect sizes across predictors.
\end{enumerate}

To address potential issues such as multicollinearity and non-linear relationships, we consider advanced techniques including Ridge regression, polynomial terms, and interaction effects.

\end{enumerate}

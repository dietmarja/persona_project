Is there is a relatively simple way to add more persona features (i.e., more columns) to the persona pool file. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

Update the persona pool CSV file:
First, you'll need to add the new column(s) to your data/inputs/persona/persona_pool.csv file. Simply add the new feature(s) as additional column(s) in the CSV file.
Modify the FocusGroupSimulator class:
You'll need to update the code that reads and processes the persona pool. This is likely in your focus_group_simulator.py file. Look for the method that loads the persona pool (it might be called something like load_persona_pool or setup_simulation).
Update prompt generation:
If you want to use these new features in generating prompts, you'll need to modify the prompt generation code. This is likely in code/sub/prompts.py.
(Optional) Update configuration:
If you want to make the new features configurable, you might need to update your config/config.yaml file.

Here's a more detailed look at steps 2 and 3:

In this example, I've added placeholders for new_feature1 and new_feature2. You would replace these with your actual new features.
Remember to handle cases where the new features might not be present in all personas (for backwards compatibility or if some personas don't have all features).

Testing:
After making these changes, thoroughly test your system to ensure it correctly handles the new features. Run simulations with personas that include the new features and check that they're being used correctly in the generated content.
Documentation:
Update your README.md or other documentation to reflect the new persona features and how they're used in the system.

By following these steps, you can flexibly add new persona features to your system. This approach allows you to easily expand the depth and complexity of your personas as your research needs evolve. CopyRetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

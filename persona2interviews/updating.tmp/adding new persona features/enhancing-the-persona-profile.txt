Change the persona profile so that is include features to enhance the performance for

tech scoring
edu scoring
ethics scoring of interview in other words: Give me a persona profile that fits each of the scoring requirements best

Certainly! I'll modify the persona profile to include features that are likely to enhance performance for tech, edu, and ethics scoring in interviews. Here's an updated persona profile that incorporates these aspects:

Let's break down the new features and how they contribute to each scoring area:

Tech Scoring Enhancements:
tech_specialization: Specific area of technological expertise (e.g., AI, cybersecurity, blockchain)
certifications: Technical certifications held (e.g., AWS, CISSP, PMP)
years_of_coding_experience: (retained from original)
research_publications: Number or list of tech-related research publications
Edu Scoring Enhancements:
education_level: (retained from original)
teaching_experience: Years or types of teaching experience
curriculum_development: Experience in developing educational curricula
research_publications: (also applies to educational research)
Ethics Scoring Enhancements:
ethical_training: Specific ethics courses or training completed
diversity_inclusion_experience: Experience with D&I initiatives
sustainability_focus: Experience with sustainability projects or initiatives
professional_affiliations: Memberships in ethics-related professional organizations
General Enhancements (can apply to all areas):
background: (retained from original, but could be more detailed)
age: (retained from original, can influence perspective and experience)
professional_affiliations: Can indicate ongoing professional development and networking
The rationale for these additions:

For tech scoring, we've added specific indicators of technological expertise and ongoing learning (specializations, certifications, research).
For edu scoring, we've included features that demonstrate not just educational attainment, but also the ability to transmit knowledge (teaching experience, curriculum development).
For ethics scoring, we've added features that show formal training in ethics, as well as practical experience in related areas like diversity and sustainability.
Some features, like research publications and professional affiliations, can contribute to multiple scoring areas depending on their specific nature.
To use this enhanced profile effectively:

For each persona, populate these fields with relevant, detailed information.
Ensure that the information is consistent with the persona's job and background.
Use this detailed profile to generate more informed and context-rich responses during interviews.
When analyzing results, you can use these additional features in your nested model testing and feature importance analysis to identify which aspects most significantly contribute to performance in each scoring area.
This enhanced profile should provide a richer basis for your personas, allowing for more nuanced and targeted performance in tech, edu, and ethics-related interview questions. It also offers more variables for your statistical analysis, potentially leading to more insightful conclusions about what factors contribute to a persona outperforming standard LLMs in these specific areas.

I want to analyse statisticalls which persona features or variables contribute to a high score (tech, edu or ethics)?

personas are currently represented like this

expert,role,background,gender,age,hobbies,style,education_level,years_of_coding_experience
Journalist specialised on Technology,moderator, NA, NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Nurse Practitioner, participant, NA, NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Financial Manager, participant, NA, NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Software Developer, participant, NA, NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
IT Manager, participant, NA, NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
...


How do I do this statistically? My idea

- Take about 20 persona with filled in slots
- Create for each persona variations like so:

Software Developer, participant,1 ,IT, 20,reading,inclusive,high,10
Software Developer, participant,0 ,Physics, 30,NA,running,cooperative,medium,12
Software Developer, participant,1 ,Computer Science, 40,rugby,authorative,medium,6

I think, This persona scheme would translate into this data scheme (I leave out participantb because everybody is a participant, but add the tech score to be predicted) 



SD,1 ,IT, 20,reading,inclusive,high,10
SD,0 ,Physics, 30,NA,running,cooperative,medium,12
SD,1 ,Computer Science, 40,rugby,authorative,medium,6
Same for the other Persona ...


Would this be a viable statistical approach? If so, what kind of desing and statistical method would be appropriate t single out the best predictor and to assess the effect size of each? What could be a problem?

Your approach to analyzing which persona features contribute to high scores (tech, edu, or ethics) is a good starting point. Let's refine this approach and discuss appropriate statistical methods.

### Refined Approach

1. Data Preparation:
   - Create variations for each persona as you suggested.
   - Ensure a balanced design with an equal number of variations for each persona.
   - Code categorical variables appropriately (e.g., one-hot encoding for background, style).

2. Data Structure:
   Your proposed structure is good. Let's refine it slightly:

   ```
   Persona,Background,Gender,Age,Hobbies,Style,Education_Level,Years_Coding,Tech_Score,Edu_Score,Ethics_Score
   SD,IT,1,20,reading,inclusive,high,10,0.75,0.60,0.45
   SD,Physics,0,30,running,cooperative,medium,12,0.70,0.65,0.50
   SD,CS,1,40,rugby,authoritative,medium,6,0.80,0.55,0.40
   ```

3. Statistical Design:
   - Multiple Linear Regression or Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
   - Possibly multilevel modeling if you want to account for the nested structure (variations within personas)

4. Statistical Methods:

   a. Multiple Linear Regression:
      - Dependent variables: Tech_Score, Edu_Score, Ethics_Score (separate models for each)
      - Independent variables: All persona features

   b. Feature Importance:
      - Use standardized coefficients to compare effect sizes
      - Employ methods like LASSO or Ridge regression for feature selection

   c. Model Diagnostics:
      - Check assumptions (linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity)
      - Assess multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

   d. Cross-validation:
      - Use k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and generalizability

5. Potential Problems and Solutions:

   a. Multicollinearity: Features might be correlated (e.g., education level and years of coding experience)
      - Solution: Use Ridge regression or LASSO for regularization

   b. Non-linear relationships: Some features might have non-linear effects on scores
      - Solution: Consider polynomial terms or generalized additive models (GAMs)

   c. Interaction effects: Combinations of features might be important
      - Solution: Include interaction terms in the model

   d. Limited sample size: With many features, you might run into overfitting
      - Solution: Use regularization techniques, consider dimension reduction (e.g., PCA)

6. Assessing Effect Sizes:
   - Use standardized coefficients (beta coefficients) to compare effect sizes across predictors
   - Calculate partial R-squared values for each predictor

7. Alternative Approaches:
   - Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines for non-linear relationships and feature importance
   - ANOVA or MANOVA if you want to treat persona types as categorical predictors

8. Reporting Results:
   - Report model R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and F-statistic
   - Present a table of coefficients with standardized betas and p-values
   - Create visualizations of the most important predictors (e.g., coefficient plots)

\subsection{Statistical Analysis of Persona Features}

To analyze the contribution of various persona features to the tech, education, and ethics scores, we employ the following statistical approach:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Preparation:} We create multiple variations for each persona, ensuring a balanced design and appropriate coding of categorical variables.

    \item \textbf{Statistical Design:} We utilize Multiple Linear Regression models, with separate models for tech, education, and ethics scores.

    \item \textbf{Model Specification:}
    \begin{equation}
        Score_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + ... + \beta_k X_{ki} + \epsilon_i
    \end{equation}
    where $Score_i$ represents the tech, education, or ethics score for the $i$-th observation, $X_{ki}$ are the persona features, and $\epsilon_i$ is the error term.

    \item \textbf{Feature Importance:} We assess feature importance using standardized coefficients and LASSO regression for feature selection.

    \item \textbf{Model Diagnostics:} We check for linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

    \item \textbf{Cross-validation:} We employ k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and generalizability.

    \item \textbf{Effect Size Assessment:} We use standardized coefficients (beta coefficients) and partial R-squared values to compare effect sizes across predictors.
\end{enumerate}

To address potential issues such as multicollinearity and non-linear relationships, we consider advanced techniques including Ridge regression, polynomial terms, and interaction effects.

\end{enumerate}



This statistical approach will allow you to rigorously analyze the relationship between persona features and scores, identifying the most important predictors and quantifying their effects. Remember to interpret the results cautiously, considering the limitations of the data and the assumptions of the statistical methods used.


Here is the context of my workVirtual personas generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) often perform differently from the original LLMs 

Here is the context of my workVirtual personas generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) often perform differently from the original LLMs \citep{beck2024sensitivity,moon2024virtual}. 
% Goal
This paper develops design principles for virtual personas that outperform LLMs on metrics such as technological depth. 
% Method
We employ a black-box testing approach to evaluate persona performance in interviews, scoring their technological, pedagogical, and ethical contributions. Our methodology uses a diverse sample of 100 personas, based on U.S. News Best Jobs Rankings 2024 \citep{usnews_best_jobs} and a standard LLM as the baseline, all of which are interviewed by a journalist persona. 
% Results
Our results show that 81\% of the personas outperform the standard LLM in technological depth. We have further investigated this effect through feature analysis and validated our findings using PCA based on the divergence of the token distribution, represented by a normalised Gramme matrix. 
Our approach shares the goal of considerable work in LLMs that aims to enhance performance through additional information, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or Knowledge Graph-Augmented Models. 
But instead of augmenting the knowledge of an LLM, it focusses on designing personas tailored to specific tasks.
}I need to find a way to select persona features that mater most with regard to scores derived from interviews. I am thinking here of nested model testing to estimate the potentiall marginal effect that the large model has. Problem is that there might be quite a number of those nested tests. Alternatively or in combination I may use a one sample t-test to test where a model outperformes a reference score, e.g., that of a standard LLM.EditThank you for providing the context of your work. Your research on virtual personas and their performance compared to standard LLMs is fascinating. To address your need for selecting persona features that matter most with regard to scores derived from interviews, I can suggest a few approaches that align with your research goals and methodology:

Nested Model Testing with Feature Selection:

Nested Model Testing with Feature SelectionClick to open code

import statsmodels.api as sm
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def nested_model_testing(X, y, n_features_to_select=5):
    # Initial feature selection
    estimator = LinearRegression()
    selector = RFE(estimator, n_features_to_select=n_features_to_select)
    selector = selector.fit(X, y)
    
    selected_features = X.columns[selector.support_]
    
    # Nested model testing
    results = []
    for i in range(1, len(selected_features) + 1):
        features = selected_features[:i]
        X_subset = X[features]
        X_subset = sm.add_constant(X_subset)  # Add constant term
        model = sm.OLS(y, X_subset).fit()
        results.append({
            'features': features,
            'r_squared': model.rsquared,
            'adj_r_squared': model.rsquared_adj,
            'aic': model.aic,
            'bic': model.bic
        })
    
    return results

# Usage
# results = nested_model_testing(X, y)
# for result in results:
#     print(f"Features: {result['features']}, R-squared: {result['r_squared']:.4f}, Adj R-squared: {result['adj_r_squared']:.4f}, AIC: {result['aic']:.2f}, BIC: {result['bic']:.2f}")



This approach combines Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for initial feature selection with nested model testing. It allows you to see how the model performance changes as you add more features, helping identify the most important ones.

One-sample t-test for Comparison with Standard LLM:

One-sample t-test for Comparison with Standard LLMClick to open code

from scipy import stats

def compare_to_standard_llm(scores, llm_score):
    t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(scores, llm_score)
    return t_statistic, p_value

# Usage
# persona_scores = [...]  # List of scores from your personas
# standard_llm_score = X.X  # Score of the standard LLM
# t_stat, p_val = compare_to_standard_llm(persona_scores, standard_llm_score)
# print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}, p-value: {p_val:.4f}")


This function performs a one-sample t-test to compare your persona scores against the standard LLM score. It helps determine if your personas significantly outperform the standard LLM.

Feature Importance using Random Forest:

Random Forest Feature ImportanceClick to open code

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def random_forest_feature_importance(X, y):
    rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    rf.fit(X, y)
    
    feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
        'feature': X.columns,
        'importance': rf.feature_importances_
    }).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.bar(feature_importance['feature'], feature_importance['importance'])
    plt.xticks(rotation=90)
    plt.xlabel('Features')
    plt.ylabel('Importance')
    plt.title('Random Forest Feature Importance')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    
    return feature_importance

# Usage
# importance = random_forest_feature_importance(X, y)
# print(importance)

This approach uses a Random Forest model to estimate feature importance, which can be a useful complement to the nested model testing.
To implement these methods in your research:

Start with the Random Forest Feature Importance to get an initial ranking of features.
Use this ranking to inform your Nested Model Testing, perhaps focusing on the top N features identified by the Random Forest.
For each nested model, perform the One-sample t-test to compare against the standard LLM performance.

This combination of methods should provide a robust analysis of which persona features contribute most significantly to outperforming the standard LLM, while also giving you statistical evidence for the overall performance comparison.
Remember to cross-validate your results and consider the interpretability of your models alongside their performance metrics. This approach aligns well with your black-box testing methodology and should provide insights into the design principles that lead to high-performing virtual personas.

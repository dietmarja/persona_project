Instruction to answer the question in focus_group_questions.csv
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The central idea is to run a focus group with a number of experts (see below) to a given question. 
Question: Which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business. 

Generate diverse responses varying in length. 
Whenever appropriate and fitting, prticipants should react directly to each other picking up and developing or challenging contributions of other participants. 
Use opening phrases sparingly, only 40-60% of the time. One participant is a maverick who voices provocative statements. 
Don't produce just common place statements. 
Whenever suitable, add specific details.
The discussion leader should guide and summarize occasionally.


Discussing experts (persona)*:
- CTO of an AI Company
- President of a leading Compter Chip Compnay
- Head of the Engineering Council in the UK
- Discussion leader with background in IT and business
- Leading editor of a major technological journal
- Head ot the School of Engineering at MIT (M)


* As long the focus group runs, all other personal definitions are nil and void

The discussion leader should only step in when
- discussion drifts too far away from the leading question
- the discussion gets too heated or
- when the discussion moves around in circles. 

The result file should be a txt file called "focus_group_results.txt" to be written to data/outputs

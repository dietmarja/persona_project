Discussion leader with background in IT and business: Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's focus group discussion. Today, we're going to talk about the digital skills that learners should acquire to be well-equipped for the business world. With rapid advancements in technology, it's crucial for individuals to stay ahead by mastering certain digital areas. I'm excited to hear your thoughts and insights on this topic. Let's kick things off by hearing what skills you all believe are most essential for success in today's digital business landscape. Who'd like to start?

Head ot the School of Engineering at MIT: In my role as the Head of the School of Engineering at MIT, I believe that a unique and highly valuable skill for learners to acquire today is proficiency in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

CTO of an AI Company: As the Chief Technology Officer of an AI company, I couldn't agree more with the importance of mastering AI and machine learning skills. These technologies are transforming industries across the board, from healthcare to finance to

President of a leading US University: As the President of a leading US university, I have seen firsthand the impact of digital skills on our students' success. One specific example that comes to mind is a student who took the initiative to learn data analytics during their time here. This student secured a highly competitive internship with a tech company, where they were able to apply their digital skills to real-world projects. This experience not only boosted their confidence but also opened up doors to exciting opportunities post-graduation. It truly illustrates the power of acquiring relevant digital skills in today's job market.

Head ot the School of Engineering at MIT: That's a fascinating example, Mr. President. I'm curious to know more about the specific data analytics skills that student acquired during their time at the university. Did they focus on a particular programming language or tools, or was it a more holistic approach to understanding data analysis concepts? Understanding the specifics of their skill development could provide valuable insights for our discussion on essential digital skills for learners.

President of a leading US University: Absolutely, as the President of a leading US university, I have observed a growing trend where students are increasingly seeking opportunities to learn not just the technical skills but also the practical application of those skills in real-world scenarios. This holistic approach to education is vital in preparing learners for the fast-paced and dynamic business environment. It's not just about mastering a specific tool or technology; it's about understanding how to adapt and innovate in response to changing digital landscapes. Emphasizing experiential learning opportunities can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, making graduates more competitive in the job market.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: From an economic perspective, it's crucial for learners to acquire skills in data analysis and interpretation. In today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze complex information and draw meaningful insights is highly sought after by employers. Understanding economic principles and how they intersect with digital technologies can give individuals a competitive edge in the business world. Additionally, proficiency in statistical software like R or Python can greatly enhance one's data analysis skills, allowing for more robust and sophisticated analyses. Integrating economic theory with practical data analysis skills can equip learners with a well-rounded foundation to navigate the digital landscape of business effectively.

President of a leading US University: Building on the points raised by the editor, it's evident that the intersection of economics and digital skills is becoming increasingly significant. As the President of a leading US university, I have seen a growing demand from students to incorporate interdisciplinary approaches into their education. By combining economic principles with digital literacy, students can gain a deeper understanding of how technology influences markets, consumer behavior, and overall business strategies. Encouraging students to explore these interdisciplinary connections not only enhances their critical thinking skills but also prepares them to tackle complex challenges in the evolving digital business landscape. Providing a well-rounded education that emphasizes both economic fundamentals and

Head of the UK Office of Labour: While the emphasis on acquiring digital skills is undoubtedly important, we must also consider the potential impact on job displacement and income inequality. As the Head of the UK Office of Labour, I believe it's crucial to address the potential consequences of solely focusing on digital competencies. We need to ensure that individuals who may not have access to or interest in acquiring high-level digital skills are not left behind in the workforce. It's essential to invest in upskilling programs that cater to a diverse range of skills and abilities to promote inclusivity and economic stability. Balancing the push for digital proficiency with measures to support all segments of the workforce is vital for creating a sustainable and equitable future.

Head ot the School of Engineering at MIT: I recall a specific personal experience that highlighted the importance of digital skills in the business world. One of our engineering students participated in a hackathon where they leveraged their coding and data analysis abilities to develop a cutting-edge application for streamlining inventory management in small businesses. This student's project caught the attention of tech entrepreneurs and investors at the event, leading to a collaboration that eventually turned into a successful startup venture. This experience exemplifies how mastering digital skills, such as coding and data analysis, can not only open doors to entrepreneurial opportunities but also drive innovation in the business realm. It underscores the transformative impact

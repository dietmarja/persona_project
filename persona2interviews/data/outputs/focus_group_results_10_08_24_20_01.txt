Discussion leader with background in IT and business: Good afternoon, everyone! Today, we're here to discuss the digital skills that learners should acquire to be well-prepared for the business world. In today's fast-paced, technology-driven environment, having

CTO of an AI Company: As the CTO of an AI company, I can't stress enough how important it is for learners to acquire skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Understanding the basics of AI algorithms, natural language processing, and neural networks can give individuals a competitive edge in industries where automation and data analysis play a significant role. Additionally, proficiency in programming languages like Python, data analytics tools like Tableau, and cloud computing platforms like AWS or Azure are also crucial in today's business landscape. These skills not only demonstrate technical expertise but also show adaptability and a willingness to embrace emerging technologies.

Head of the UK Office of Labour: Could you please clarify how these technical skills apply to learners who may not necessarily be pursuing a career in technology-focused industries? While I understand the importance of AI and data analytics in today's business landscape,

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: I understand the emphasis on technical skills, but let's not overlook the importance of honing critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of economics, for example, having a deep understanding of economic theory, statistical analysis, and the ability to communicate complex ideas effectively can be just as valuable, if not more so, than specific technical skills. While being tech-savvy is crucial in today's world, let's not underestimate the power of a well-rounded, analytical mind in navigating the complexities of the business world.

Discussion leader with background in IT and business: It's interesting to hear different perspectives on the digital skills learners should acquire for the business world. Let's delve deeper into how a combination of technical skills and critical thinking abilities can truly set individuals apart in today's competitive landscape. How do you think we can strike a balance between these two aspects?

President of a leading US University: In my role as President of a leading US University, I see firsthand the importance of providing students with a well-rounded education that combines technical expertise with critical thinking and problem-solving skills. While it's crucial for learners to acquire digital skills like AI, data analytics, and programming, we also emphasize the development of soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability. These skills are essential in preparing students to not only excel in their chosen field but also to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of the business world. By offering a diverse range of courses and opportunities for experiential learning, we aim to

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I absolutely agree with the emphasis on both technical skills and soft skills. In the UK, we are seeing a growing demand for individuals who possess a combination of digital proficiency and critical thinking abilities. Employers are not only looking for candidates who can leverage technology effectively but also those who can think creatively, adapt to change, and communicate clearly. As the Head of the UK Office of Labour, it's crucial for us to support initiatives that equip learners with a holistic skill set that will make them valuable assets in the workforce. By promoting a well-rounded approach to education and training, we can better prepare individuals to succeed in today's dynamic business environment.

CTO of an AI Company: One specific experience that comes to mind is when we were developing a new AI-powered product for a client in the healthcare industry. While technical expertise was essential in building the machine learning algorithms and designing the system architecture, what truly made a difference was the ability of our team to think critically and creatively when faced with complex challenges. We had to not only understand the intricate data sets and coding requirements but also communicate effectively with the client to ensure that the final product met their specific needs and regulations. This experience reinforced the importance of having a well-rounded skill set that goes beyond just technical know-how in delivering successful technology solutions in the business world.

President of a leading US University: I completely resonate with the importance of a balanced skill set in today's business world. At our university, we have implemented a curriculum that integrates technical courses with liberal arts education to ensure our students are equipped with both digital competencies and critical thinking abilities. For instance, our business programs not only cover areas like data analysis and coding but also focus on communication, leadership, and ethical decision-making. This holistic approach aims to prepare students to excel in a digital-first environment while also being able to adapt to the changing landscape of the global economy. It's essential for educational institutions to continuously evolve their offerings to equip learners with the diverse skills needed to thrive in a competitive market.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: While I appreciate the focus on a well-rounded education, I would argue that in the rapidly evolving digital age, technical skills have become non-negotiable. The business landscape is increasingly driven by data analytics

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I understand the emphasis on technical skills in today's business world, but let's not forget about the importance of fostering creativity and innovation. While technical skills are vital, the ability to think outside the box, solve problems creatively, and adapt to new situations is equally crucial in driving businesses forward. Encouraging learners to cultivate their creativity alongside their technical abilities can pave the way for groundbreaking solutions and advancements in various industries. It's about striking a balance between technical proficiency and creative thinking to truly excel in the digital age.

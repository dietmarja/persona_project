Discussion leader with background in IT and business: Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining this focus group discussion. Today, we will be exploring the digital skills that are essential for learners to acquire in order to thrive in the business world. With the

President of a leading US University: I believe that in today's fast-paced digital landscape, learners should focus less on specific technical skills and more on cultivating a growth mindset and adaptability. The ability to learn quickly, pivot when necessary, and embrace new technologies as they emerge will be more valuable in the long run than mastering a particular digital area that may become obsolete in a few years.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: I respectfully disagree with the notion that learners should prioritize adaptability over specific technical skills. In the field of economics, for example, having a deep understanding of data analysis and statistical modeling is crucial for making

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I agree with both perspectives shared so far. While adaptability and a growth mindset are important, I also believe that having a solid foundation in specific digital areas is essential for individuals entering the business world today. In the context of the labor market, proficiency in data analysis, digital marketing, and project management can significantly enhance one's employability and career prospects. These skills are in high demand across various industries and can give learners a competitive edge in the job market.

Discussion leader with background in IT and business: Those are excellent points raised by our participants so far. How do you all feel about the balance between developing adaptability and mastering specific digital skills? Should learners focus more on one than the other, or is there a way to effectively prioritize both aspects? Let's dive deeper into this discussion.

President of a leading US University: I believe that in today's rapidly changing digital landscape, focusing too much on specific technical skills can actually be detrimental in the long run. Technology advances at such a rapid pace that what may be considered a crucial skill today could easily become outdated tomorrow. Instead, learners should prioritize developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are more transferable and timeless in nature. These foundational skills will enable individuals to adapt to any new technology or digital area that may emerge in the future.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: I agree with the point about the importance of developing timeless skills like critical thinking and problem-solving. However, in the field of economics, there are certain digital areas that are becoming increasingly vital for professionals. For instance, proficiency in econometrics and data analysis tools like R or Python can greatly enhance one's ability to analyze complex economic data and make informed decisions. By combining technical skills with a strong foundation in critical thinking, individuals can excel in the modern business world where data-driven insights play a crucial role in decision-making processes.

President of a leading US University: I hear what you're all saying about the importance of technical skills and adaptability, but let me throw a curveball here. What if we prioritize teaching students how to effectively collaborate and communicate in a digital environment? With the rise of remote work and virtual teams, the ability to work seamlessly with others across digital platforms can be a game-changer in today's business world. Let's not forget the human element in all this digital talk.

Discussion leader with background in IT and business: That's an interesting perspective on the importance of digital collaboration skills, especially in the context of remote work. How do you see teamwork and communication evolving in a digital landscape, and what implications does this have

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I couldn't agree more with the emphasis on digital collaboration skills. In the realm of labor, the ability to effectively work in virtual teams and leverage digital communication tools is becoming increasingly essential. Employers are seeking candidates who can navigate digital platforms with ease, communicate clearly across various channels, and collaborate seamlessly with colleagues regardless of physical distance. Developing these interpersonal skills in a digital context can set learners apart in a competitive job market where remote work is on the rise.

CTO of an AI Company: In my role as the Chief Technology Officer of an AI company, I've seen firsthand the importance of staying abreast of the latest digital trends and technologies. One specific experience that stands out is when our team had to quickly adapt to using a new virtual collaboration platform due to the shift to remote work during the pandemic. We had to train our employees on how to effectively utilize the platform for project management, communication, and collaboration.

Moreover, in the realm of artificial intelligence, having a strong foundation in programming languages like Python and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch is paramount. These technical skills

President of a leading US University: While technical skills like programming and data analysis are undoubtedly important in today's digital age, I dare to suggest that soft skills such as emotional intelligence, empathy, and cultural competence are equally if not more crucial in the business world. In an increasingly interconnected global economy, the ability to understand and relate to diverse perspectives, communicate effectively across cultures, and navigate complex interpersonal dynamics can make or break success in any digital area of business. Let's not underestimate the power of these human-centric skills in a tech-driven world.

Head ot the School of Engineering at MIT: I completely agree with the emphasis on soft skills alongside technical competencies. At the School of Engineering at MIT, we emphasize the importance of a well-rounded education that includes not only technical expertise but also communication, teamwork, and ethical decision-making. In the context of digital areas for business, having a strong foundation in soft skills can differentiate learners and professionals, enabling them to effectively collaborate, lead, and innovate in an increasingly digital and interconnected world. It's this combination of technical prowess and emotional intelligence that can truly drive success in business today.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: Building on the points made by my esteemed colleagues, I believe that the convergence of technical and soft skills is paramount for learners aiming to excel in today's digital business landscape. In the field of economics, for instance, professionals must not only possess quantitative abilities for data analysis but also the capacity to communicate findings effectively, understand the human implications of economic decisions, and collaborate with diverse teams. By marrying technical proficiency with emotional intelligence, individuals can navigate the complexities of modern business environments and drive innovation and growth.

Discussion leader with background in IT and business: Thank you all for a rich and insightful discussion on the digital areas learners should acquire to thrive in today's business world. We've touched on the importance of technical skills, adaptability, soft skills,

Discussion:

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I believe that learners should focus less on specific digital skills and more on developing a growth mindset and adaptability. In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, it's crucial to be able to learn new technologies quickly and pivot when industry trends change. Rather than getting fixated on mastering a certain platform, individuals should cultivate the ability to be agile and resilient in the face of uncertainty. This mindset will serve them far better than any single technical skill in the long run.

President of a leading US University: I couldn't agree more with the perspective shared about the importance of developing a growth mindset. At our university, we emphasize not just teaching technical skills but also fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. These skills are transferable across various digital fields and will enable learners to adapt to whatever the future of business brings. It's about preparing students to be lifelong learners who can thrive in a rapidly changing world. Embracing technology is crucial, but having a strong foundation

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I challenge the notion that focusing on soft skills is enough in today's digital age. While adaptability and growth mindset are crucial, technical proficiency in key digital areas cannot be overlooked. The reality is that businesses are increasingly reliant on technology, and individuals who lack specific digital skills may find themselves at a disadvantage in the job market. It's essential to strike a balance between soft skills and digital competencies to truly excel in the current business environment. Simply relying on adaptability may not be sufficient to stay competitive in a highly digitalized world.

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I respectfully challenge the emphasis on technical skills over soft skills. In a world where automation is on the rise, it's the uniquely human abilities like creativity, emotional intelligence, and communication that will set individuals apart. While digital skills are important, they can often be learned on the job, whereas cultivating strong interpersonal skills is a longer and more complex process. Businesses are craving employees who can collaborate effectively, lead with empathy, and navigate complex relationships - qualities that cannot be replaced by AI. Soft skills may be the true currency of the future workplace, where human connection is more valuable than ever.

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I have a contrarian viewpoint on the debate between technical skills and soft skills. While both are undeniably important, I argue that in the digital age, the ability to learn and adapt quickly is the ultimate skill that learners should acquire. Technology is advancing at an exponential rate, rendering specific technical skills obsolete faster than ever before. Those who can continuously educate themselves on emerging trends and technologies will be the most sought after in the business world. Rather than fixating on any one set of skills, individuals should prioritize the skill of learning itself - that's what will truly future-proof their careers.

CTO of an AI Company: I appreciate the diverse perspectives shared regarding the skills learners should acquire for business success. As someone deeply involved in AI, I see firsthand the importance of both technical and soft skills in our industry. While technical proficiency is crucial for roles in AI and tech, I cannot underestimate the value of soft skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. In fact, AI companies often seek individuals who can collaborate effectively across disciplines and communicate complex concepts to diverse audiences. The ability

Discussion leader with background in IT and business: It's fascinating to see the diverse views on the essential skills for learners in today's business landscape. While there are differing opinions on the balance between technical and soft skills, it's evident that a combination of both is valuable. The notion of cultivating a growth mindset, adaptability, and continuous learning resonates strongly. As we navigate the digital age, the ability to blend technical expertise with strong interpersonal skills seems key for long-term success. Could anyone elaborate on how they see these skills translating into specific job roles within the business sector?

CTO of an AI Company: I agree that combining technical expertise with soft skills is crucial, especially in the AI field. AI development requires a blend of advanced technical knowledge and effective communication to bridge the gap between tech teams and business stakeholders. In my experience, the most successful AI professionals possess not only coding prowess but also the ability to convey complex ideas in a clear, compelling manner. As AI continues to shape various industries, individuals who can leverage their technical skills while understanding business needs will thrive. It's about striking a balance between the algorithms and the human touch in the AI ecosystem.

CTO of an AI Company: In my experience, the integration of technical and soft skills is paramount in the AI industry. While technical proficiency is a baseline requirement, the ability to collaborate, communicate effectively, and understand business objectives is what elevates AI professionals. We often see projects succeed not just because of technical excellence, but due to clear communication of AI solutions' benefits to non-technical stakeholders. This is where the intersection of technology and business acumen becomes essential for driving innovation and adoption. Individuals who can bridge this gap become invaluable assets in AI companies, ensuring that cutting-edge technologies align with real-world needs and goals.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: I'd like to challenge the notion that technical skills should outweigh soft skills in preparing learners for the business world. While technical proficiency is undoubtedly important, the ability to communicate, collaborate, and think critically are equally crucial, if not more so. In the field of economics, understanding complex concepts and being able to articulate them to a diverse audience is paramount. Moreover, the rapidly changing economic landscape requires individuals who can adapt, innovate, and problem-solve effectively. It's the harmonious combination of technical know-how and soft skills that truly propels individuals to success in the dynamic realm of economics and business.

Discussion leader with background in IT and business: It's interesting to see the emphasis on the blend of technical and soft skills in preparing learners for the business world, as highlighted by our CTO and Leading editor. This fusion seems to be crucial across various industries, including AI and economics. The ability to communicate complex ideas, collaborate effectively, and adapt to change is a recurring theme. Could our participants delve deeper into how these skills can be honed and applied in specific business contexts? Let's explore practical examples of how this integration plays out in real-world scenarios.

CTO of an AI Company: I wholeheartedly agree with the emphasis on the combination of technical and soft skills in the AI field. In our company, we've seen that the most successful AI projects are led by teams that not only excel in coding and data analysis but also possess strong communication and problem-solving abilities. AI isn't just about algorithms; it's about understanding the broader implications and being able to convey the value proposition to diverse stakeholders. The ability to collaborate across different functions and translate technical jargon into actionable insights is what sets top AI professionals apart. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, individuals who can navigate the intersection of technology, business, and human interaction will be the drivers of innovation and success.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: I fully support the perspective on the importance of blending technical and soft skills in the field of economics. As an editor, I often see the significance of not just understanding economic theories but also being able to communicate their implications clearly to a wide audience. In today's interconnected world, economists who can bridge the gap between complex analysis and real-world applications are highly sought after. It's not enough to crunch numbers; effective storytelling and engagement are key in conveying economic insights to policymakers, businesses, and the public. The ability to navigate interdisciplinary collaborations and translate economic trends into actionable strategies is where the true impact lies.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: While I agree that a balance of technical and soft skills is vital in economics, I believe that the landscape is rapidly shifting towards a more multidisciplinary approach. Economists today need to not only excel in traditional economic analysis but also integrate insights from diverse fields such as sociology, psychology, and even AI. The ability to synthesize information across disciplines and communicate findings effectively will be the hallmark of successful economists in the digital age.

Head of the UK Office of Labour: The debate around technical skills versus soft skills seems outdated in the current job market. What truly matters is the ability to adapt, innovate, and learn continuously, regardless of the specific skills one possesses. In a world where job roles are evolving at an unprecedented pace, focusing on a fixed set of skills may lead to obsolescence. Individuals should prioritize developing a learning mindset that allows them to acquire new skills as needed, rather than boxing themselves into predefined categories. Embracing uncertainty and change will be more beneficial for future employability than mastering any particular technical

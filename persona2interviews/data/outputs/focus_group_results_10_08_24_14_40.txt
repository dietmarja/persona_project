Discussion leader with background in IT and business: Hello everyone, thank you for joining this focus group discussion today. We're here to talk about the crucial digital skills that learners should acquire to excel in the business world. In today's fast-paced and tech-driven environment, it's essential to stay ahead by developing proficiency in certain digital areas. Let's delve into this topic together and explore the key skills necessary for success in the business realm. Who would like to kick us off? What digital skills do you think are most vital for learners nowadays?

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I believe one of the key digital areas that learners should focus on acquiring today is data analytics. In the business world, data is everywhere, and the ability to analyze and derive insights from data sets can give individuals a significant edge. Understanding how to use tools like Excel, SQL, or even more advanced data analysis software can really make a difference in decision-making processes. It's all about making data-driven decisions to stay competitive.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: I completely agree with the importance of data analytics skills. In addition to that, I would also emphasize the significance of digital marketing skills. With the majority of business transactions and interactions happening online, having a solid understanding of digital marketing strategies, social media marketing, and SEO can really set learners apart. Knowing how to effectively

CTO of an AI Company: I have a slightly different take on this. While data analytics and digital marketing are crucial, let's not forget about the rising importance of artificial intelligence skills. As the CTO of an AI company, I see firsthand the transformative power AI has in various industries. Learners who can grasp the fundamentals of AI, machine learning, and automation will be in high demand. So, perhaps focusing more on AI and its applications could give learners a competitive advantage in the future job market.

President of a leading US University: I'm intrigued by your perspective on the importance of artificial intelligence skills. Could you elaborate on specific AI applications that you believe would be particularly valuable for learners to acquire? It would be interesting to hear more about how AI is revolutionizing different industries and the skills that would be most beneficial for learners to cultivate in this area.

Head of the UK Office of Labour: Certainly, the applications of artificial intelligence in various industries are vast and rapidly expanding. Learners should consider familiarizing themselves with AI technologies such as natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics. These skills can be highly valuable in fields like healthcare, finance, and even customer service, where AI is being increasingly integrated to streamline processes and enhance decision-making. AI is definitely a field to watch and invest in for the future.

Discussion leader with background in IT and business: It's fascinating to hear the diverse perspectives on the digital skills learners should acquire for success in business. Let's shift our focus a bit. How do you think traditional business skills, like communication, leadership, and problem-solving, should be integrated with digital skills to create well-rounded professionals? How important is it to strike a balance between these skill sets in today's business landscape?

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: I believe that the integration of traditional business skills with digital skills is pivotal for creating well-rounded professionals. While technical proficiency is essential in today's digital age, the ability to effectively communicate, lead teams, and solve problems remains timeless and invaluable. Combining digital skills with strong interpersonal and leadership capabilities can truly differentiate individuals in the business world. It's about marrying the best of both worlds to excel in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I see the value in integrating traditional business skills with digital skills, but I also believe there is a danger in overemphasizing one over the other. In our quest to stay ahead in the digital realm, we shouldn't neglect the foundational skills that have been fundamental to business success for decades. Strong communication, leadership,

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: I agree with the need to strike a balance between traditional business skills and digital skills. The key lies in understanding that these skill sets are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary. For instance, someone with strong communication skills can effectively convey complex technical information to non-technical stakeholders, bridging the gap between digital expertise and business understanding. Ultimately, it's about cultivating a diverse set of skills that work in harmony to drive success in the modern business environment.

CTO of an AI Company: I would challenge the notion of balance between traditional business skills and digital skills. In today's rapidly evolving landscape, where technology is disrupting industries at an unprecedented pace, I believe that a heavier emphasis on digital skills may be necessary for individuals to stay relevant and competitive. While traditional skills are undoubtedly important, businesses are increasingly placing a premium on those who can drive innovation and leverage the latest technologies to gain a strategic edge. Perhaps it's time to rethink the balance and prioritize digital skills

Head of the UK Office of Labour: I appreciate the counterpoint regarding the need to focus more on digital skills over traditional business skills. As the Head of the UK Office of Labour, I must consider the broader implications of this shift. While digital skills are undeniably crucial in today's economy, we must also ensure that individuals are equipped with the foundational skills that foster adaptability, critical thinking, and resilience. Striking a balance between digital proficiency and traditional business acumen can create well-rounded professionals who are prepared to navigate the ever-changing landscape of the business world. It's about finding the right blend of skills to thrive in the 21st-century workplace.

Leading editor of a major journal in economics: Building on our discussion of digital skills and traditional business skills, I'd like to introduce the topic of ethics in technology. As more businesses rely on digital tools and AI technologies, ethical considerations around data privacy, algorithm bias, and the impact of automation on jobs have come to the forefront. How do you think learners can be prepared to navigate these ethical complexities in the digital age? Should ethics in technology be a core component of education and training for future business professionals? I believe this is a critical aspect to consider as we shape the skill sets of the next generation of business leaders.

CTO of an AI Company: Ethics in technology is undoubtedly an important topic, but I would argue that the focus on ethics should not overshadow the need for innovation and progress in the tech industry. Yes, we must address ethical concerns surrounding AI and digital advancements, but let's not stifle creativity and exploration in the name of caution. It's a delicate balance between fostering innovation and ensuring ethical practices, and individuals should be prepared to navigate this complex landscape. After all, pushing the boundaries of technology often leads to groundbreaking advancements that can benefit society as a whole.

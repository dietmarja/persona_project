  "As a general user, you would likely respond:\n\nCondition 1: In advanced AI knowledge, common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation.\n\nCondition 2: In basic AI knowledge, common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models include techniques that help the model generalize better and not memorize the training data too closely.",
  "As a general user, I would answer:\n\nCondition 1 (Advanced knowledge level in AI): Common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation.\n\nCondition 2 (Low knowledge level in AI): Common techniques to prevent overfitting in machine learning models are making sure the model doesn't memorize the training data too much by adding penalties for large weights or stopping training early."

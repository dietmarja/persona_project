Moderator: Good afternoon, everyone. Today's question for our focus group discussion is: Which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business? Let's start the discussion.

President of a leading Computer Chip Company: I believe learners should prioritize data analytics skills. In today's data-driven business environment, the ability to analyze and make data-driven decisions is crucial.

Head of Engineering Council in the UK: I agree. Data analytics is essential, but I would also emphasize the importance of cybersecurity knowledge. With the rising number of cyber threats, businesses need employees who can protect their digital assets.

CTO of an AI Company: Building on that, artificial intelligence and machine learning skills are becoming increasingly valuable. Understanding AI technologies can give learners a competitive edge in various industries.

Leading editor of a major technological journal: While AI is important, I'd also highlight the significance of cloud computing. Cloud technology enables businesses to scale efficiently and adapt to changing market demands.

Head of the School of Engineering at MIT: In addition to AI and cloud computing, learners should also focus on user experience (UX) design. Creating intuitive and user-friendly digital interfaces is crucial for engaging customers and driving business success.

Discussion Leader with background in IT and business: It seems like we all agree on the importance of data analytics, cybersecurity, AI, cloud computing, and UX design. How about we discuss a more contentious area? What about blockchain technology? Is it necessary for learners to acquire blockchain skills for business success?

Maverick: Blockchain is overhyped. While it has its use cases, not every business scenario requires blockchain technology. Learners should prioritize mastering existing digital areas rather than getting caught up in the blockchain hype.

Moderator: Thank you, Maverick, for your provocative input. It's important to consider the practicality and relevance of emerging technologies like blockchain in the business context. Let's continue exploring other digital areas that learners should prioritize.

CTO of an AI Company: I'd like to bring up

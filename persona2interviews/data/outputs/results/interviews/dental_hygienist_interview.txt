Dental Hygienist: Thank you for having me. In today's digital age, I believe learners should focus on acquiring skills in digital marketing, data analytics, and telehealth technologies. These areas are becoming increasingly important in the healthcare industry, including dental practices.

Dental Hygienist: As a Dental Hygienist, I believe that learners today should focus on acquiring digital skills that will be relevant and beneficial for their future in business. One important area that learners should consider is digital marketing. In today's digital age, businesses rely heavily on online marketing strategies to reach their target audience and drive growth. By learning digital marketing skills such as social media management, search engine optimization, and email marketing, learners can position themselves as valuable assets in any business setting.

Another crucial digital area for learners to acquire is data analytics. In the age of big data, businesses are constantly collecting and analyzing data to make informed decisions. By understanding how to collect, interpret, and apply data effectively, learners can help businesses optimize their processes, improve customer experiences, and drive business success.

Moreover, proficiency in website development and design is also a valuable skill for learners to have in today's business world. A well-designed and user-friendly website is essential for businesses to establish their online presence and attract customers. By learning how to create and maintain websites, learners can help businesses enhance their online visibility and drive sales.

In conclusion, acquiring digital skills such as digital marketing, data analytics, and website development can greatly benefit learners in preparing them for success in the business world. By staying current with digital trends and technologies, learners can position themselves as valuable assets to any business and stay ahead in today's competitive job market.

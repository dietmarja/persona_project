Moderator: Interview with Construction Worker:

Journalist: Thank you for joining me today. As a construction worker, you have firsthand experience in a field that traditionally may not require a lot of digital skills. However, with the advancement of technology, there is a growing need for all professionals, including those in construction, to acquire digital skills. In your opinion, which digital areas do you think learners should acquire today to be best suited for business?

Construction Worker: Thank you for having me. In my opinion, learners in today's business environment should definitely focus on acquiring digital skills in areas such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), project management software, and mobile applications for on-site productivity. BIM allows us to create digital representations of the physical and functional characteristics of a project, which helps streamline the construction process and improve collaboration among all stakeholders. Project management software is essential for keeping track of tasks, deadlines, and budgets, while mobile apps can help us access important information on the go and communicate with team members efficiently.

Journalist: Those are excellent points. It's clear that digital skills can greatly enhance efficiency and productivity in the construction industry. How do you think the adoption of these digital skills has impacted your own work and the construction projects you are involved in?

Construction Worker: As a construction worker, I believe that there are several key digital areas that learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, even in industries like construction where the focus may not traditionally be on digital skills. One crucial area is Building Information Modeling (BIM), which involves creating digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of a building. BIM has become increasingly important in the construction industry as a way to improve collaboration, efficiency, and accuracy throughout the design and construction process.

Another important digital area for learners to acquire is proficiency in project management software. Being able to effectively manage projects digitally can help streamline workflows, improve communication among team members, and ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. This can be especially beneficial in the construction industry, where projects often involve numerous stakeholders and moving parts.

Additionally, learners would benefit from acquiring skills in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology. These technologies can be used in construction for tasks such as virtual walkthroughs of building designs, virtual safety training, and visualizing construction progress. By understanding how to leverage VR and AR tools, learners can enhance their ability to communicate and collaborate effectively on construction projects.

In my own experience, I have seen how digital skills can make a significant impact on construction projects. For example, using BIM software has allowed our team to identify and resolve design clashes before construction even begins, saving time and cost. Similarly, project management software has enabled us to track project milestones and deadlines more efficiently, leading to smoother project delivery.

Overall, by acquiring digital skills such as BIM, project management software, and VR/AR technology, learners can position themselves for success in the business world, even in industries like construction that may not seem inherently digital-focused. These skills can help improve productivity, collaboration, and project outcomes, ultimately leading to a competitive edge in the ever-evolving business landscape.

Moderator: Interview with a Midwife on digital skills for learners in business:

Journalist: Thank you for joining me today. As a midwife, you have valuable expertise in healthcare. In today's digital age, what areas do you believe learners should acquire to be best suited for business, especially in the field of healthcare?

Midwife: Thank you for having me. I believe that learners in the healthcare field should acquire skills in telemedicine, electronic health records (EHR) management, and healthcare data analytics. Telemedicine is becoming increasingly important in providing access to care remotely, while EHR management skills are essential for maintaining patient records efficiently. And healthcare data analytics can help improve patient outcomes and streamline healthcare processes.

Journalist: Those are all critical skills indeed. With the rapid advancement of technology in healthcare, how do you think learners can stay updated on the latest developments and trends in the field?

Midwife: Continuous learning is key in staying updated in the healthcare field. Learners can attend conferences, workshops, and online courses to keep abreast of the latest developments. Networking with other professionals and joining professional associations can also be helpful in staying informed about emerging trends and best practices.

Journalist: That's great advice. In your experience, how have digital skills impacted your work as a midwife, and how do you see them shaping the future of healthcare?

Midwife: Digital skills have transformed the way we deliver care as midwives. From using telehealth platforms to monitor patients remotely to accessing real-time data for informed decision-making, digital skills have improved efficiency and patient outcomes. I believe that in the future, healthcare will become even more integrated with technology, from using AI for diagnostics to wearable devices for continuous monitoring.

Journalist: Thank you for sharing your insights. It's clear that acquiring digital skills is essential for learners to excel in business, especially in the ever-evolving field of healthcare. Your expertise is truly valuable in guiding aspiring professionals in this digital age.

Midwife: In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, there are several key areas that learners should acquire to be best suited for business. As a midwife with expertise in healthcare but limited experience in coding and technology, I believe that learners can benefit greatly from developing skills in the following digital areas:

1. Data analysis and interpretation: In the healthcare field, data plays a crucial role in decision-making and improving patient outcomes. Learners should acquire skills in data analysis to extract valuable insights from large datasets, make informed decisions, and track key performance indicators. By understanding and utilizing tools like Excel, Tableau, or even basic coding languages like Python, learners can effectively analyze data and drive meaningful change within their organizations.

2. Digital marketing and social media management: In today's digital age, having a strong online presence is essential for businesses to reach their target audience and stay competitive. Learners should acquire knowledge in digital marketing strategies, search engine optimization (SEO), and social media management to effectively promote their services or products. By understanding how to create engaging content, optimize online campaigns, and analyze social media metrics, learners can attract new clients and boost their business's visibility.

3. Cybersecurity awareness: With the increasing reliance on technology and digital platforms, cybersecurity has become a growing concern for businesses across all industries. Learners should acquire basic knowledge of cybersecurity principles, including how to protect sensitive data, recognize potential threats, and implement best practices to safeguard their digital assets. By staying informed about the latest cyber threats and security measures, learners can minimize the risk of data breaches and protect their business from potential threats.

Overall, by acquiring skills in data analysis, digital marketing, and cybersecurity awareness, learners can position themselves for success in today's digital-driven business environment. While my background may not be heavily focused on technology, I recognize the importance of these digital areas in fostering innovation, driving growth, and staying competitive in the modern marketplace.

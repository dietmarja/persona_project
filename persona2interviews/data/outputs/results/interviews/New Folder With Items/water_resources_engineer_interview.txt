Moderator: Hello everyone, today we have the pleasure of speaking with a Water Resources Engineer who will share insights on the digital areas that learners should acquire to be best suited for business. As a Journalist specialised in Technology, I am excited to delve into this conversation.

Water Resources Engineer, could you please share with us your thoughts on the importance of data analytics skills for learners entering the business world today, especially in the field of water resources management?

Water Resources Engineer: In today's fast-paced business world, learners should acquire digital skills that are not only relevant but also adaptable to the evolving landscape. As a Water Resources Engineer, I have seen the importance of incorporating digital technology into our field to optimize water management strategies and ensure sustainable practices.

One area that learners should focus on is data analytics. The ability to collect, analyze, and interpret data is crucial for making informed business decisions. In water resources engineering, for example, data analytics can help us better understand hydrological patterns, optimize water distribution systems, and predict potential risks such as floods or droughts.

Another important digital area for learners is programming and automation. By developing coding skills, learners can create tools and models to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately save time and resources. In water resources engineering, programming skills can be used to develop simulations for complex hydraulic systems or automate data collection from monitoring devices.

Additionally, learners should consider expanding their knowledge in geographical information systems (GIS). GIS technology allows us to visualize and analyze spatial data, which is invaluable in various industries including environmental management and urban planning. In water resources engineering, GIS can be used to map watersheds, identify areas prone to pollution, and plan for sustainable water resource development.

Overall, by acquiring digital skills in data analytics, programming, and GIS, learners can not only stay ahead in today's business world but also make significant contributions to their respective fields. As a Water Resources Engineer, I have seen the transformative power of these digital areas in advancing our understanding of water systems and driving sustainable practices.

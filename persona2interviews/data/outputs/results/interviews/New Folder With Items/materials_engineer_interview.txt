Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce our two guests for today's interview. On one side, we have our technology journalist who will be asking insightful questions on the digital skills required for today's business environment. And on the other side, we have our materials engineer who will provide valuable insights on the importance of technology in their field.

To kick things off, I'd like to ask our materials engineer: In your experience, how have digital skills such as data analysis and programming helped you in your work in the field of materials engineering? And how do you think these skills could benefit learners looking to enter the business world today?

Materials Engineer: In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, there are several digital areas that learners should acquire to be best suited for business. As a Materials Engineer, I believe that having a strong foundation in data analytics and visualization is crucial for success in any industry.

The ability to collect, analyze, and interpret data has become increasingly important for businesses to make informed decisions and stay ahead of the competition. By understanding how to use tools like Python, R, or Tableau to manipulate data and create visualizations, learners can gain valuable insights that can drive business growth and innovation.

Moreover, in the field of materials engineering, knowledge of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software is essential for designing and modeling complex structures and components. By mastering CAD programs like AutoCAD or SolidWorks, learners can create detailed designs, simulate different scenarios, and optimize their products for efficiency and performance.

Additionally, having a basic understanding of digital marketing and e-commerce can also be beneficial for learners entering the business world. Knowing how to leverage social media, SEO, and online advertising can help businesses reach a wider audience, drive sales, and build brand awareness in today's digital-first economy.

Overall, by acquiring skills in data analytics, CAD software, and digital marketing, learners can position themselves as valuable assets in the business world, regardless of their background or industry. The ability to adapt to new technologies and tools will be essential for success in the digital age, and continuous learning and upskilling will be key to staying competitive in the ever-changing business landscape.

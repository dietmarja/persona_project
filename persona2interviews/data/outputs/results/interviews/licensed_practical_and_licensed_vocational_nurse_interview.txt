Licensed Practical and Licensed Vocational Nurse: In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, learners looking to excel in the business side of the industry should consider acquiring digital skills that can enhance their ability to analyze data, streamline processes, and improve overall efficiencies. One key area that I believe is crucial for learners to acquire today is proficiency in healthcare informatics.

Healthcare informatics involves the use of technology to organize and analyze healthcare data. By understanding how to effectively utilize electronic health records (EHRs), data analytics tools, and other digital platforms, learners can obtain valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and drive operational efficiency.

For example, as a Licensed Practical Nurse, being proficient in healthcare informatics can enable you to effectively manage patient records, track treatment outcomes, and identify trends that can lead to more personalized and effective care. This skill set can also be valuable in business settings, where data-driven decision-making is becoming increasingly important.

Additionally, learners should consider acquiring knowledge in telehealth technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telehealth services, and being well-versed in virtual care platforms, remote monitoring devices, and other telehealth tools can provide a competitive edge in the job market. Understanding how to utilize these technologies can improve access to care, enhance patient engagement, and drive cost savings for healthcare organizations.

Overall, by acquiring digital skills in healthcare informatics and telehealth technologies, learners can position themselves as valuable assets in the business side of healthcare. These skills not only demonstrate adaptability and innovation but also have the potential to drive positive outcomes for both patients and healthcare organizations.

Moderator: Based on your expertise, how do you think the adoption of telemedicine in veterinary care will impact traditional practices and client-patient relationships in the future?
Veterinarian: Veterinarian: The adoption of telemedicine in veterinary care will have a significant impact on traditional practices and client-patient relationships in the future. While telemedicine offers convenience and accessibility for both veterinarians and pet owners, it may also change the dynamics of the traditional in-person veterinary visit. 

In traditional practices, veterinarians rely on physical examinations and face-to-face interactions with both the pet and the owner to diagnose and treat medical conditions. With telemedicine, this aspect of the veterinary care experience may be compromised, as veterinarians may not have the opportunity to physically examine the animal or interact with the owner in person.

On the other hand, telemedicine can provide a valuable alternative for pet owners who may have difficulty accessing traditional veterinary care due to location

Do you think there will be a need for specific training or certification in telemedicine for veterinarians in the future to ensure quality and ethical care?
Veterinarian: Veterinarian: Yes, I believe that there will be a need for specific training or certification in telemedicine for veterinarians in the future to ensure quality and ethical care. Telemedicine introduces new challenges and considerations that may not be covered in traditional veterinary education. 

Training in telemedicine can help veterinarians understand how to effectively conduct virtual consultations, utilize digital tools for remote diagnosis and treatment, and navigate legal and ethical considerations surrounding telehealth services. Certification in telemedicine can also provide reassurance to pet owners that their veterinarian is equipped to provide high-quality care through digital platforms.

Additionally, ongoing education and training in telemedicine can help veterinarians stay current with the latest advancements in technology and best practices in virtual care. By acquiring these digital skills and certifications

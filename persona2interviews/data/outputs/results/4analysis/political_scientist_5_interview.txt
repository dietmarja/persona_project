Moderator: Interview with Political Scientist:

Journalist: Welcome, thank you for joining me today. Let's dive right in - in your opinion, which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business?

Political Scientist: Thank you for having me. In today's digital age, I believe learners should focus on acquiring skills in data analytics, digital marketing, and cybersecurity. Understanding how to analyze and interpret data is crucial for making informed business decisions. Additionally, digital marketing skills can help individuals effectively reach and engage with customers in an increasingly online marketplace. Lastly, cybersecurity knowledge is essential to protect sensitive information and prevent cyberattacks.

Journalist: Those are definitely important areas to consider. How do you think these digital skills intersect with the political landscape, particularly in terms of business regulations and data privacy concerns?

Political Scientist: As a Political Scientist with a background in Economics, I believe that learners today should focus on acquiring digital skills that are not only crucial for business success but also align with their academic backgrounds. One area that I would recommend is data analysis and interpretation. In the era of big data, being able to analyze and draw insights from data is essential for making informed business decisions. For example, understanding economic data can help businesses identify trends, forecast market changes, and develop strategies for growth.

Another important digital area for learners to acquire is digital marketing. As businesses increasingly rely on online platforms to reach their target audience, having a strong grasp of digital marketing techniques can give professionals a competitive edge. As an economist, understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics can be leveraged in digital marketing strategies to effectively promote products or services.

Furthermore, proficiency in business analytics tools such as Microsoft Excel, Tableau, or SAP can be highly beneficial for learners looking to enter the business world. These tools help in organizing data, creating visualizations, and making data-driven decisions, which are valuable skills in any business setting.

In group settings, I would collaborate with colleagues from technical backgrounds to gain a deeper understanding of coding languages such as Python or R, which are widely used in data analysis and programming. By leveraging each other's expertise, we can create synergies and develop well-rounded digital skills that encompass both the technical and analytical aspects necessary for success in the business world.

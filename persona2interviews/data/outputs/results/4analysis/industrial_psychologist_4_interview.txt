Journalist: Given the rapid pace of technological advancements, how do you think businesses can best support their employees in acquiring and developing these essential digital skills?

Industrial Psychologist: When considering which digital skills learners should acquire to be best suited for business, there are a few key areas that come to mind from an industrial psychologist's perspective.

Firstly, data analysis and interpretation skills are essential in the current business landscape. As businesses collect vast amounts of data, the ability to analyze and draw meaningful insights from this data is highly valued. For example, learners could benefit from acquiring skills in data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI, as well as statistical analysis tools like SPSS or R.

Secondly, proficiency in digital communication tools is crucial for effective collaboration in the modern workplace. Learners should be comfortable using platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Google Workspace to facilitate communication, project management, and team collaboration. As someone with a background in organizational behavior, I understand the importance of clear and efficient communication for team dynamics and overall organizational success.

Additionally, I would recommend that learners acquire basic programming skills, even if they do not have a background in coding. Understanding fundamental concepts in programming can be beneficial for tasks like automation, problem-solving, and working with data. For instance, knowledge of Python or R can help learners streamline processes and analyze data more effectively in various business contexts.

In conclusion, a combination of data analysis, digital communication, and basic programming skills can equip learners with the necessary capabilities to thrive in today's business environment. By continuously adapting and learning in these digital areas, individuals can enhance their employability and contribute meaningfully to organizational success.

Moderator: **Interview**

Journalist: Thank you for joining me today. As a Political Scientist, you have a unique perspective on the intersection of technology and education. In your opinion, which digital skills and areas of knowledge do you believe learners should acquire today to be best suited for business?

Political Scientist: Thank you for having me. In today's fast-paced and increasingly digital business landscape, I believe that learners should prioritize acquiring skills such as data analysis, digital marketing, and proficiency in using productivity tools like project management software. Understanding how to navigate and leverage technology is crucial for success in the modern business world.

Journalist: That's a great point. With the increasing importance of data-driven decision-making and the rise of digital marketing, it's clear that these skills are essential for today's learners. How do you think traditional educational institutions can adapt to ensure that students are equipped with these digital skills?

Political Scientist: Traditional educational institutions will need to evolve their curricula to incorporate more hands-on, practical experience with technology. They can also partner with industry leaders to offer specialized courses and internships that provide real-world exposure to digital tools and strategies. Additionally, investing in training for educators to stay up-to-date with the latest technological advancements is crucial for preparing students for the demands of the business world.

Journalist: Absolutely. It's essential for educational institutions to stay current with industry trends and collaborate with businesses to provide students with the skills they need to succeed in today's digital economy. Thank you for sharing your insights on this important topic.

**Group Discussion**

Journalist: Welcome everyone to today's focus group on digital skills in business. I'd like to introduce our participants. We have John, a Marketing Manager with expertise in digital advertising, Sarah, a Software Engineer specializing in AI and machine learning, and Emily, a Business Analyst with a background in data analytics. 

John, Sarah, and Emily, thank you for joining us today. Given your diverse backgrounds in technology and business, I'm excited to hear your perspectives on the digital skills that learners should acquire to excel in the business world today. 

Based on what we've heard so far, I'd like to ask the group: How do you think the rapid advancements in technology are shaping the skills that are most valuable for business professionals today and in the future?

Political Scientist: When it comes to the digital areas that learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, I believe that having a strong foundation in data analysis and statistics is crucial. As a Political Scientist with coding experience, I have seen firsthand the power of being able to gather, analyze, and interpret data to make informed decisions and predictions.

For example, in my research on voting behavior, being able to use statistical tools to analyze survey data allowed me to uncover patterns and trends that informed my understanding of voter preferences. This same skill set is highly valuable in the business world, where data-driven decision-making is increasingly the norm.

Additionally, I would recommend learners to develop skills in programming languages such as Python or R. These languages are not only versatile and in high demand across industries, but they also provide a solid foundation for understanding coding principles that can be applied to a variety of tasks, from web development to data visualization.

Furthermore, a strong grasp of digital marketing strategies and tools is essential for anyone looking to succeed in business today. Understanding how to use social media, SEO, and email marketing effectively can help individuals and businesses reach their target audiences and drive growth.

In a group setting, I would build on others' contributions by emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary skills in the digital age. For example, combining data analysis skills with knowledge of political science can yield valuable insights for businesses operating in complex regulatory environments or facing political risks.

Overall, I believe that a combination of data analysis, programming, and digital marketing skills is highly valuable for learners looking to excel in the business world today, and my background in Political Science and coding has equipped me with the tools to navigate these areas effectively.

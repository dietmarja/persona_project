Industrial Psychologist: As an Industrial Psychologist with a background in Business Psychology and some coding experience, I believe there are several key digital areas that learners should acquire to be best suited for business today.

Firstly, data analytics skills are increasingly in demand across industries. Being able to analyze and interpret data can provide valuable insights for decision-making and strategy development. For example, understanding how to use tools like Excel or more advanced data analytics software can help learners stand out in a competitive job market. Additionally, knowledge of data visualization techniques can enhance their ability to communicate complex information in a clear and compelling way to stakeholders.

Secondly, proficiency in digital marketing is crucial in today's business landscape. As more companies shift their focus to online platforms, having expertise in areas such as social media marketing, search engine optimization, and content creation can be highly advantageous. This could involve learning about different digital marketing tools and strategies, as well as staying updated on the latest trends in the field.

Furthermore, having a strong understanding of cybersecurity is essential in a world where cyber threats are becoming increasingly prevalent. Learners should be aware of common cybersecurity risks and best practices for protecting sensitive information. This knowledge can help them contribute to maintaining a secure digital environment within an organization and mitigate potential risks to the business.

In conclusion, acquiring digital skills in data analytics, digital marketing, and cybersecurity can prepare learners to thrive in today's business environment. By developing expertise in these areas, individuals can enhance their employability and contribute effectively to the success of their organizations.

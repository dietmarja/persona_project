Moderator: Welcome everyone to our focus group discussion on "Which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business". Let's start by introducing ourselves. 
I'll go first, I am a Journalist specialized in Technology. 

Participant 1, would you like to introduce yourself next?

IT Manager: When it comes to digital areas that learners should acquire to be best suited for business today, I believe that a solid foundation in cybersecurity is crucial. As an IT Manager with a background in cybersecurity, I know firsthand how important it is for businesses to protect their digital assets and customer data from cyber threats. In today's interconnected world, cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and having professionals who understand how to prevent, detect, and respond to these threats is essential for any business.

Additionally, I would recommend that learners also focus on acquiring skills in coding. With 9 years of coding experience myself, I have seen how coding is becoming increasingly important across all industries. Whether it's developing new software applications, automating business processes, or analyzing data, coding skills are in high demand and can give learners a competitive edge in the job market.

Furthermore, I would suggest that learners also consider developing skills in data analytics and machine learning. In today's data-driven business environment, being able to extract insights from large datasets and make data-driven decisions is a valuable skill. Machine learning, in particular, is transforming industries by enabling businesses to build predictive models and automate decision-making processes.

In conclusion, I believe that learners who acquire skills in cybersecurity, coding, data analytics, and machine learning will be well-positioned for success in today's digital business landscape. By combining these skills, individuals can not only protect businesses from cyber threats but also drive innovation and create value through technology.

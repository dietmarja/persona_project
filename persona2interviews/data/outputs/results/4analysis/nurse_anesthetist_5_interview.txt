Moderator: Interview with Nurse Anesthetist:

Journalist: Thank you for joining me today. As a Nurse Anesthetist, you have a unique perspective on the intersection of healthcare and technology. In your opinion, which digital areas do you think learners should acquire today to be best suited for business in this field?

Nurse Anesthetist: Thank you for having me. I believe that learners in the healthcare field, particularly in anesthesia, should focus on acquiring skills in electronic health records (EHR) systems, telemedicine technologies, and data analytics. Understanding how to effectively navigate and utilize EHR systems is crucial for efficient patient care and documentation. Telemedicine technologies are becoming increasingly important, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, as they allow for remote consultations and monitoring of patients. Lastly, data analytics skills are essential for making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes based on data-driven insights.

Journalist: Those are excellent points. With the rapid advancement of technology in healthcare, it's clear that acquiring digital skills is essential for staying competitive in the field. How do you see these digital areas impacting the future of healthcare and the role of Nurse Anesthetists specifically?

Nurse Anesthetist: In today's evolving healthcare landscape, having a solid foundation in digital areas is essential for learners to thrive in the business side of the industry. As a Nurse Anesthetist with a background in Health Sciences and coding experience, I believe there are several key digital areas that learners should acquire to be best suited for business.

One area that stands out is data analytics. With the increasing emphasis on evidence-based practice and quality improvement in healthcare, the ability to analyze and interpret data is crucial. For example, in anesthesia practice, having the skills to analyze patient outcomes data can help identify areas for improvement and demonstrate value to stakeholders. Learning data analytics tools such as Tableau or Python can give learners a competitive edge in leveraging data to drive business decisions.

Another important digital area is telehealth. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telehealth services, and it is likely to remain a significant component of healthcare delivery in the future. Understanding how to effectively utilize telehealth platforms and technology can open up new business opportunities, such as providing virtual anesthesia consultations or remote monitoring services.

Additionally, proficiency in healthcare informatics is becoming increasingly important. As healthcare systems transition to electronic health records and digital documentation, learners with knowledge of healthcare information systems and interoperability standards will be better equipped to navigate complex healthcare IT environments. This expertise can be particularly valuable in roles that involve streamlining workflows, optimizing efficiency, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.

In my own experience, I have seen how having coding skills has been beneficial in my practice as a Nurse Anesthetist. For example, being able to customize electronic anesthesia records or develop automated reporting tools has allowed me to improve workflow efficiency and enhance patient safety.

Overall, by acquiring expertise in data analytics, telehealth, healthcare informatics, and other relevant digital areas, learners can position themselves for success in the dynamic and technology-driven healthcare business environment. It's important to stay curious, be willing to adapt to new technologies, and continuously seek opportunities to expand one's digital skillset.

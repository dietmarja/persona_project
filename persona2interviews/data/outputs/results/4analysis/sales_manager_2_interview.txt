Moderator: Interview with Sales Manager:

Journalist: Today, we are discussing the digital areas that learners should acquire to be best suited for business. In your role as a Sales Manager, what do you think are the most important digital skills for individuals entering the business world today?

Sales Manager: Thank you for having me. In my experience, I believe that having strong skills in data analysis, social media marketing, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools are essential for success in the business world today. Data analysis helps us make informed decisions, social media marketing allows us to reach a wide audience, and CRM tools help us manage and nurture relationships with customers effectively.

Journalist: Those are definitely key skills in today's digital business landscape. How do you see the role of artificial intelligence and automation impacting sales and business processes in the near future?

Sales Manager: When considering which digital areas learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, I believe a combination of technical and business skills is essential. Given my background in Business Administration with an MBA education and coding experience, I would recommend focusing on the following digital areas:

1. Data Analytics: Understanding how to collect, analyze, and interpret data is crucial in today's data-driven business environment. Proficiency in data analytics tools such as Excel, Tableau, or Python can provide valuable insights for decision-making and strategy development. For example, during my time as a Sales Manager, I utilized data analytics to identify customer trends and preferences, leading to more targeted marketing campaigns and increased sales.

2. Digital Marketing: With the shift towards online platforms, having a strong grasp of digital marketing concepts is invaluable. Skills in areas such as social media marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), and email marketing can help businesses reach and engage with their target audience effectively. I've seen firsthand how a well-executed digital marketing strategy can drive brand awareness and customer acquisition, ultimately contributing to business growth.

3. Coding and Web Development: As someone with coding experience, I can attest to the importance of technical skills in today's business landscape. Proficiency in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or HTML can open up opportunities to automate tasks, build websites, or develop innovative solutions. In a previous role, I developed a custom CRM system for my sales team, streamlining processes and improving overall efficiency.

By acquiring these digital skills, learners can enhance their competitiveness in the business world and adapt to the evolving technological landscape. It's important to continuously upskill and stay abreast of industry trends to remain valuable assets to any organization.

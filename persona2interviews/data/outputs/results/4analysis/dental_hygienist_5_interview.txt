Moderator: Interviewer: Hello, thank you for joining me today. As a Dental Hygienist, what digital areas do you believe learners should acquire today to be best suited for business?

Dental Hygienist: Thank you for having me. I believe that learners should focus on acquiring skills in digital marketing, data analysis, and telehealth technologies. With the rise of online presence and telemedicine, having knowledge in these areas can greatly benefit individuals in the business world, especially in the healthcare industry.

Interviewer: That's a great point. Digital marketing and telehealth technologies are definitely important skills to have in today's business world. Can you elaborate on why data analysis is also important for learners to acquire?

Dental Hygienist: Absolutely. Data analysis skills are crucial in making informed decisions and developing effective strategies for business growth. By being able to analyze data effectively, learners can identify trends, customer preferences, and areas for improvement within their business. This can ultimately lead to better decision-making and a more successful business overall.

Interviewer: Thank you for highlighting the importance of data analysis skills in today's business landscape. It's clear that a well-rounded skill set in digital areas is essential for learners to succeed in their careers.

Dental Hygienist: As a Dental Hygienist with a background in Nutrition, I believe that learners today should focus on acquiring digital skills that are becoming increasingly essential in the business world. One crucial area is information literacy, which involves the ability to find, evaluate, and use digital information effectively. In the healthcare field, being able to navigate through vast amounts of online data to stay up-to-date with the latest research and guidelines is crucial for providing high-quality patient care.

Another important digital skill for learners is proficiency in digital communication tools. In today's interconnected world, being able to effectively communicate through email, video conferencing, and social media is key for networking, collaborating with colleagues, and reaching a wider audience. For instance, as a Dental Hygienist, being able to engage with patients through social media platforms can help in promoting oral health awareness and attracting new clients to the practice.

Moreover, learners should consider acquiring basic knowledge of data analysis and interpretation. In the healthcare field, understanding how to collect and analyze data can lead to valuable insights for improving patient outcomes and optimizing clinic operations. For example, knowing how to interpret patient feedback surveys or analyze appointment scheduling patterns can help in enhancing overall patient satisfaction and workflow efficiency.

While my background may not include coding experience, I recognize the growing importance of digital literacy skills in various professional domains. By acquiring these digital competencies, learners can better position themselves for success in today's business landscape, including the healthcare industry. As a Dental Hygienist, staying updated on the latest digital trends and tools can ultimately contribute to providing better patient care and advancing in the field.

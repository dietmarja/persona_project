Moderator: Interview with a Dental Hygienist on digital skills for business:

Journalist: Thank you for joining me today. Let's dive right in - in your opinion, which digital areas do you believe learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, specifically in the field of dental hygiene?

Dental Hygienist: Thank you for having me. In the field of dental hygiene, I believe learners should focus on acquiring skills in digital marketing, tele-dentistry, and practice management software. 

Journalist: That's great advice. Digital marketing is indeed crucial for reaching and engaging with patients in today's digital age. How do you see tele-dentistry shaping the future of dental hygiene practice?

Dental Hygienist: Tele-dentistry allows us to provide consultations and oral health education remotely, making dental care more accessible. It's important for learners to understand how to effectively use tele-dentistry tools to connect with patients and provide quality care.

Journalist: Absolutely, tele-dentistry has the potential to revolutionize the way dental care is delivered. Practice management software is also key for running a successful dental practice efficiently. How do you think learners can benefit from mastering this digital area?

Dental Hygienist: Practice management software streamlines appointment scheduling, billing, and patient records management. By mastering these tools, learners can improve efficiency, accuracy, and patient experience in their practice.

Journalist: Thank you for sharing your insights on the essential digital areas for learners in the field of dental hygiene. It's clear that acquiring these digital skills is crucial for staying competitive in the evolving business landscape.

Dental Hygienist: As a Dental Hygienist with a background in Nutrition, I believe that learners today should acquire digital skills that are not only relevant to the business world but also to their specific fields of interest. In the healthcare sector, including dentistry, having a strong foundation in digital communication and data management is crucial.

One area that learners should focus on is electronic health records (EHR) systems. Proficiency in using EHR systems is becoming increasingly important in healthcare settings, as it streamlines patient care, enhances communication between healthcare providers, and ensures data security and accuracy. For instance, being able to effectively navigate and input information into EHR systems can help dental hygienists like myself provide better patient care and track treatment outcomes.

Another important digital skill is understanding and utilizing telehealth technologies. The use of telehealth has grown significantly, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and being able to conduct virtual appointments and consultations is now a valuable skill for healthcare professionals. For example, knowing how to use telehealth platforms can help dental hygienists reach patients who may not be able to visit the office in person, thereby expanding the reach of their practice.

Furthermore, learners should also consider acquiring basic knowledge in digital marketing and social media management. In today's digital age, having a strong online presence is essential for businesses to reach their target audience and engage with customers. As a dental hygienist, knowing how to leverage social media to educate patients about oral health practices or promote services can help build a successful practice.

In conclusion, while my background may not be in coding or traditional business practices, I believe that acquiring digital skills related to EHR systems, telehealth technologies, and digital marketing can help learners in healthcare fields like dentistry succeed in today's competitive business landscape. By staying up-to-date with digital trends and technologies, professionals can enhance their practice, improve patient care, and ultimately thrive in their careers.

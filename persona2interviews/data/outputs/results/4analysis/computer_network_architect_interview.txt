By understanding digital marketing tactics such as SEO, social media marketing, and email marketing, learners can help businesses effectively promote their products or services, increase brand awareness, and drive customer engagement and sales.

Overall, by acquiring skills in data analytics, cybersecurity, and digital marketing, learners can position themselves as valuable assets to businesses in today's digital-driven economy. These skills will not only enhance their career prospects but also enable them to make a significant impact on the success and growth of the businesses they work for.

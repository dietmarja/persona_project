Moderator: Interview with a Veterinarian:

Journalist: Hi, thank you for joining me today. As a veterinarian, you have a unique perspective on the intersection of technology and business. In your opinion, which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business in the field of veterinary medicine?

Veterinarian: Thank you for having me. In the field of veterinary medicine, I believe learners should focus on acquiring skills in telemedicine and digital record-keeping systems. With the rise of telemedicine, especially in light of the pandemic, being able to provide virtual consultations and remote monitoring of pets is becoming increasingly important. Additionally, digital record-keeping systems help streamline workflows and improve communication among veterinary teams.

Journalist: Those are definitely important skills to have in today's digitally driven world. How do you think the integration of technology has impacted the way veterinarians provide care to their patients? Have there been any challenges or opportunities that have arisen as a result?

Veterinarian: As a Veterinarian with a background in Zoology and coding experience, I believe learners today should acquire digital skills that are not only relevant to the business world but also have a significant impact on the field of veterinary medicine. 

One important digital area that learners should acquire is data analysis and interpretation. In the veterinary field, being able to analyze and extract insights from data can greatly improve patient care and research outcomes. For example, understanding how to analyze electronic health records or genetic data can lead to better treatment plans or the discovery of new insights into animal diseases.

Another crucial digital skill is communication through digital platforms. With the rise of telemedicine and online consultations, being able to effectively communicate with clients and colleagues through digital channels is essential. This includes skills such as writing clear and concise emails, using teleconferencing tools, and maintaining a professional online presence through social media.

Additionally, learners should consider acquiring basic coding skills, as technology plays an increasingly important role in veterinary practice. For example, being able to write a script to automate certain tasks or analyze large datasets can be highly beneficial. My own experience in coding has allowed me to develop applications to track patient appointments and reminders, improving efficiency in my practice.

Overall, acquiring digital skills that are relevant to the veterinary field and business world can set learners up for success in their careers. By focusing on data analysis, digital communication, and coding, individuals can adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of veterinary medicine and stand out in the competitive business environment.

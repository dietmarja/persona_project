Medical and Health Services Manager: When it comes to which digital areas learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, I believe that having a strong foundation in healthcare technology is crucial. In today's increasingly digital world, being well-versed in electronic health records (EHR) systems, telemedicine platforms, and health informatics is essential for success in the healthcare industry. 

For example, my background in Healthcare Administration has shown me the importance of understanding how EHR systems work and how they can improve patient care and streamline administrative processes. By having the skills to efficiently navigate and utilize these systems, learners can stand out in the job market and contribute to the overall efficiency of healthcare organizations.

Additionally, with the growing popularity of telemedicine, having experience with telemedicine platforms is becoming more valuable. Being able to effectively communicate with patients and provide care remotely is a skill that is in high demand, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic which has accelerated the adoption of telemedicine.

Furthermore, knowledge of health informatics is becoming increasingly important as we generate more and more data in healthcare. Understanding how to collect, analyze, and utilize data to improve patient outcomes and organizational efficiency is a valuable skill that can set learners apart in the business world.

In conclusion, acquiring skills in healthcare technology such as EHR systems, telemedicine platforms, and health informatics is crucial for learners looking to succeed in the healthcare industry. By staying up to date with the latest digital tools and platforms, learners can position themselves as valuable assets to healthcare organizations and businesses.

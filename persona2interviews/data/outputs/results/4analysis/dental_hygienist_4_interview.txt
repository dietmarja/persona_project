Moderator: **Interview with Dental Hygienist on digital skills for business success**

Journalist: Thank you for joining me today. As a Dental Hygienist, what digital areas do you think learners should acquire today to be best suited for business?

Dental Hygienist: Thank you for having me. I believe that learners should focus on acquiring skills in digital marketing, social media management, and data analytics. These skills are essential for businesses to thrive in today's digital age.

Journalist: That's a great point. With the rise of online platforms and data-driven decision making, these skills are becoming increasingly important. How do you think these digital skills can specifically benefit someone in the dental industry?

Dental Hygienist: In the dental industry, digital marketing can help attract new patients and retain existing ones. Social media management allows us to engage with our community and build a strong online presence. Data analytics can help us track patient satisfaction, treatment outcomes, and overall business performance.

Journalist: It's fascinating to see how digital skills can have a direct impact on the success of a dental practice. How do you think these skills can be most effectively acquired by learners, especially those already working in the industry?

Dental Hygienist: I would recommend taking online courses, attending workshops, and engaging in hands-on learning experiences. It's also important to stay updated on the latest trends and technologies in the digital space to remain competitive in the industry.

Journalist: That sounds like solid advice. Continuous learning and staying current with digital trends are key to success in today's fast-paced business environment. Thank you for sharing your insights on this topic.

Dental Hygienist: When considering which digital areas learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, I would suggest a multifaceted approach that encompasses both technical skills and soft skills. 

From my perspective as a Dental Hygienist with a background in Public Health and some coding experience, I believe that learners should prioritize acquiring skills in data analysis and visualization. In today's data-driven business world, the ability to collect, analyze, and interpret data is crucial for making informed decisions. For instance, in public health, data analysis skills are essential for assessing community health needs and measuring the impact of health interventions.

Moreover, learners should also focus on acquiring skills in digital marketing. With the shift towards online platforms and e-commerce, businesses need to have a strong digital presence to reach their target audience effectively. As a dental hygienist, having a solid understanding of digital marketing techniques can help attract new patients and retain existing ones. For example, knowing how to optimize a practice's website for search engines can help increase its visibility and attract more potential clients.

Additionally, soft skills such as communication, problem-solving, and adaptability are also crucial for success in the business world. As a dental hygienist, effective communication skills are essential for building rapport with patients and collaborating with other healthcare professionals. Being able to quickly adapt to new technologies and problem-solve on the fly is also valuable in fast-paced work environments.

In conclusion, learners should prioritize acquiring skills in data analysis, digital marketing, and soft skills to be best suited for business today. By developing a well-rounded skill set that encompasses both technical and interpersonal competencies, individuals can position themselves for success in the ever-evolving digital landscape of business.

Moderator: Interview with Sales Manager:

Journalist: Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. In today's rapidly changing business landscape, which digital areas do you believe learners should focus on acquiring to be best suited for the world of business?

Sales Manager: Thank you for having me. I believe that learners should focus on acquiring skills in digital marketing, data analytics, and sales automation. These areas are crucial for businesses to stay competitive and reach their target audience effectively.

Journalist: How important do you think it is for individuals to have a combination of both technical and soft skills in the digital age? How can they balance these skills to excel in a sales role?

Sales Manager: When considering which digital areas learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, my background in Psychology and coding experience leads me to value a combination of technical skills and soft skills. 

From a technical perspective, I believe that learners should focus on acquiring knowledge in data analytics and visualization. In today's digital age, businesses are drowning in data but starving for insights. The ability to analyze and interpret data is becoming increasingly important for making informed business decisions. For example, having data analytics skills can help a marketing team identify trends in customer behavior, optimize campaigns, and improve ROI.

Furthermore, skills in web development and digital marketing are also crucial in today's business landscape. Understanding how to create user-friendly websites and leverage digital channels for marketing purposes can give learners a competitive edge in the job market. As a Sales Manager, I have seen how having a strong online presence and utilizing digital marketing strategies can significantly impact sales performance.

In addition to technical skills, soft skills such as emotional intelligence, communication, and problem-solving are essential for success in the business world. As a Psychology graduate, I understand the importance of understanding human behavior and effectively communicating with others. These skills are invaluable in sales and other business roles where building relationships and understanding customer needs are key to success.

In conclusion, learners who equip themselves with a combination of technical skills such as data analytics and web development, along with soft skills like emotional intelligence and effective communication, will be well-positioned for success in today's business world. By blending the technical and human aspects of business, individuals can stand out in a competitive job market and thrive in various business settings.

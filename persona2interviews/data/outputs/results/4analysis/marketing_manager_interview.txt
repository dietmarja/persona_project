Moderator: As a journalist specialized in technology, I am here to discuss the essential digital skills that learners should acquire to best prepare themselves for the business world. Today, I am speaking with a Marketing Manager who can provide valuable insights on this topic.

Let's start by introducing yourself and sharing your thoughts on which digital areas learners should focus on to enhance their future prospects in the business world.

Marketing Manager: 
"Hello everyone, I'm excited to be here and share my thoughts on this important topic. In my opinion, learners should acquire skills in data analytics, social media marketing, and SEO to be best suited for business in today's digital age. These skills are crucial for understanding consumer behavior, crafting effective marketing strategies, and driving business growth."

Now, let's move on to our group discussion. I would like to take a moment for everyone to introduce themselves and briefly share their thoughts on the digital skills that are most important for succeeding in the business world today. Let's start with you, John.

Marketing Manager: When it comes to digital areas that learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, I believe that having a good foundation in coding is essential. As someone with 4 years of coding experience, I have seen firsthand how valuable coding skills can be in a business setting. 

One area that learners should focus on is data analytics. In today's digital age, businesses are collecting large amounts of data, and being able to analyze and interpret this data is crucial for making informed business decisions. Knowing how to use tools like Google Analytics or SQL can give learners a competitive edge in the job market.

Another important digital area for learners to acquire is social media marketing. Social media has become a powerful tool for businesses to reach their target audience and engage with customers. Understanding how to create effective social media campaigns, analyze metrics, and engage with followers can be a valuable skill for anyone looking to work in marketing.

In addition, having knowledge of search engine optimization (SEO) is also important for businesses to ensure their online presence is optimized for search engines like Google. Being able to understand how to improve website ranking, drive organic traffic, and conduct keyword research can be beneficial for businesses looking to improve their online visibility.

Overall, having a combination of coding skills, data analytics, social media marketing, and SEO knowledge can make learners well-equipped for the digital demands of today's business world.

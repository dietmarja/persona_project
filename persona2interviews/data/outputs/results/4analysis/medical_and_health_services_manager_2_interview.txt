Moderator: Interview with Medical and Health Services Manager:

Journalist: "Thank you for joining me today. In today's digital age, it is crucial for learners to acquire certain digital skills to succeed in the business world. From your perspective as a Medical and Health Services Manager, which digital areas do you believe learners should focus on to be best suited for business in the healthcare industry?"

Medical and Health Services Manager: "Thank you for having me. In the healthcare industry, I believe learners should focus on acquiring skills in telemedicine and telehealth technology. With the increasing importance of remote patient care and digital health records, having a strong understanding of these technologies can help professionals provide more efficient and effective care to patients."

Journalist: "That's a great point. As technology continues to advance in the healthcare industry, it's crucial for professionals to adapt and stay up to date with the latest digital tools. In addition to telemedicine and telehealth technology, are there any other digital areas that you think are important for learners to acquire?"

Medical and Health Services Manager: "Absolutely. Learners should also focus on data analytics and electronic health records (EHR) systems. Analyzing data can help healthcare professionals make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes. In addition, proficiency in EHR systems is essential for managing patient information securely and efficiently."

Journalist: "Thank you for highlighting the importance of data analytics and EHR systems. These skills are indeed crucial for healthcare professionals to effectively manage patient care and streamline processes. As technology continues to evolve, what advice would you give to learners who are looking to stay ahead in the healthcare industry?"

Medical and Health Services Manager: "My advice would be to stay curious and open-minded about new technologies. The healthcare industry is constantly evolving, and professionals need to be adaptable and willing to learn new digital skills. It's also important to seek out training and development opportunities to stay current with industry trends and best practices."

Journalist: "Thank you for sharing your insights and advice. It's clear that acquiring digital skills is essential for learners to succeed in the healthcare industry. I appreciate your time and expertise on this topic."

Medical and Health Services Manager: When considering which digital areas learners should acquire today to be best suited for business, I believe that a combination of skills in health informatics, data analytics, and coding can be particularly valuable, especially in the healthcare industry.

Having a background in Public Health and an MBA education, I have recognized the increasing importance of health informatics in managing and utilizing health data effectively. Skills in health informatics, including electronic health record systems and health data management, can greatly enhance a learner's ability to navigate the complex healthcare landscape and make informed decisions.

Additionally, data analytics skills are essential in today's data-driven business environment. Being able to analyze and interpret large datasets can provide valuable insights for making strategic business decisions. For example, in healthcare management, understanding healthcare data analytics can help in identifying trends, optimizing workflows, and improving patient outcomes.

Moreover, drawing from my 2 years of coding experience, I have seen first-hand the impact that coding skills can have on streamlining processes and developing innovative solutions. Whether it's automating repetitive tasks or developing custom software applications, coding proficiency can give learners a competitive edge in the business world.

By combining expertise in health informatics, data analytics, and coding, learners can position themselves as valuable assets in various business settings, particularly in the healthcare industry where technology plays a crucial role in improving operations and patient care.

In a group setting, I would also encourage exploring other digital areas such as cybersecurity, telehealth technologies, and digital marketing, as they are increasingly relevant in today's business landscape and can complement the skills and knowledge of the group members. By building on each other's contributions and sharing insights from different professional backgrounds, we can create synergy and develop a comprehensive understanding of the digital skills needed to succeed in business today.

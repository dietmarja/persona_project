Speech-Language Pathologist: As a Speech-Language Pathologist with a background in Neuroscience, I believe there are several digital areas that learners should acquire today to be best suited for business. 

Firstly, I would emphasize the importance of data analysis skills. In today's business world, data is king, and being able to analyze and interpret data can provide valuable insights for decision-making. For example, by mastering data analysis tools like Python or R, learners can uncover patterns and trends that can drive business strategies forward. 

Additionally, I would highlight the significance of digital marketing skills. With the increasing reliance on online platforms for marketing purposes, having a strong understanding of digital marketing techniques such as SEO, SEM, and social media marketing can give learners a competitive edge in the business world. For instance, being able to create targeted online campaigns can help businesses reach their desired audience more effectively. 

Furthermore, I would suggest that learners acquire proficiency in project management tools and techniques. In a fast-paced business environment, being able to effectively manage projects, timelines, and resources is crucial for success. By mastering project management software like Asana or Trello, learners can streamline workflows and ensure projects are completed efficiently. 

Drawing from my coding experience, I would also recommend learners to acquire basic coding skills. While not everyone needs to be a software developer, having a foundational understanding of coding languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript can be beneficial in various business roles. For example, being able to customize a website or troubleshoot technical issues independently can save time and resources for a business. 

In group settings, I would build on others' contributions by highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of these digital areas. For instance, data analysis skills can complement digital marketing efforts by providing data-driven insights for marketing campaigns. By combining expertise in different digital areas, learners can create synergies that drive business growth and innovation. 

Overall, by acquiring digital skills in data analysis, digital marketing, project management, and coding, learners can position themselves effectively for success in the business world.

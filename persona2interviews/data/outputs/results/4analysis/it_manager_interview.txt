Moderator: Interviewer: Hello and thank you for joining me today. As an IT Manager, you must have a good understanding of the digital skills required in today's business world. In your opinion, which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business?

IT Manager: Thank you for having me. There are a few key digital areas that I believe learners should focus on to be well-prepared for the business world today. Firstly, I would say that having a strong understanding of data analytics and data management is crucial. With the amount of data being generated and collected by businesses, being able to analyze and derive insights from this data is a valuable skill.

Additionally, proficiency in cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important as businesses are faced with more sophisticated cyber threats. Having knowledge of how to protect data and systems from cyber attacks is essential in today's digital landscape.

Another important digital area for learners to acquire is cloud computing. As more businesses migrate their operations to the cloud, having skills in cloud computing can be a significant advantage in the job market.

Lastly, I would also recommend that learners develop their skills in digital marketing and e-commerce. With the rise of online shopping and digital marketing channels, understanding how to leverage these platforms effectively can give individuals a competitive edge in the business world.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your insights. It's clear that these digital areas are indeed crucial for learners to focus on in order to thrive in today's business environment. In your experience, have you seen a shift in the digital skills that businesses are looking for in recent years?

IT Manager: When it comes to preparing for the digital landscape of today's business world, there are several key areas that learners should acquire to stay competitive and excel in their careers. Drawing from my background in Information Systems and coding experience, I believe that a solid foundation in the following digital areas is essential:

1. **Data Analytics and Visualization**: In today's data-driven business environment, the ability to collect, analyze, and derive meaningful insights from large datasets is crucial. Learners should acquire skills in data analytics tools like Python, R, or SQL, as well as data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI. For example, in one project I led, we used data analytics to identify customer behavior patterns, leading to targeted marketing strategies which significantly improved sales performance.

2. **Cybersecurity**: With the rise of cyber threats and data breaches, cybersecurity has become a top priority for businesses. Learners should understand the fundamentals of cybersecurity, including threat detection, risk mitigation, and incident response. Having a strong understanding of cybersecurity principles is vital for protecting sensitive business information and maintaining customer trust. In my role as an IT Manager, I have implemented robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our systems and data against potential threats.

3. **Cloud Computing**: The shift to cloud-based services has transformed the way businesses operate, offering scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. Learners should acquire knowledge of cloud computing platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to understand how to leverage cloud technologies for storage, computing, and application deployment. Implementing cloud solutions in my previous projects has enabled seamless collaboration and improved efficiency across departments.

4. **Software Development and Automation**: With automation becoming increasingly prevalent in business processes, learners should have a strong foundation in software development and automation tools. Proficiency in programming languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript can empower learners to automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and develop custom applications to drive business innovation. I have utilized automation tools to streamline our software deployment processes, reducing manual errors and improving deployment speed.

By acquiring these digital areas, learners can position themselves for success in today's rapidly evolving business landscape. It is essential to stay agile and continuously upskill to meet the demands of the digital economy and drive business growth.

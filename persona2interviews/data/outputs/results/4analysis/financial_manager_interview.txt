Moderator: Interview with Financial Manager:

Journalist: "Hello, thank you for joining me today. As a Financial Manager, you have firsthand experience in the business world. In your opinion, which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business?"

Financial Manager: "Thank you for having me. I believe that learners should focus on acquiring skills in data analysis and interpretation. With the amount of data available in today's business world, being able to analyze and draw insights from data is crucial for making informed decisions. Additionally, proficiency in using financial management software and understanding e-commerce platforms can also give learners a competitive edge in the business world."

Journalist: "That's a great insight. Data analysis and financial management skills are definitely essential in today's digital business landscape. How do you think these digital skills can impact the overall success of businesses, especially in terms of financial performance and strategic planning?"

Financial Manager: In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, there are several digital areas that learners should acquire to be best suited for business, especially from a financial manager's perspective. With my background in accounting, master's education, and coding experience, I believe that a combination of financial technology (Fintech), data analytics, and coding skills are essential for future business success.

Firstly, a strong understanding of financial technology (Fintech) is crucial for individuals entering the business world today. Fintech encompasses a wide range of technology-driven financial services, such as blockchain, cryptocurrency, and online payment systems. Familiarity with Fintech not only enhances one's ability to adapt to the digital transformation happening in the finance industry but also provides opportunities for innovation and efficiency within financial processes. For example, knowing how blockchain technology works could revolutionize the way companies manage their supply chain or track financial transactions securely.

Secondly, data analytics skills are becoming increasingly important for making informed business decisions in today's data-driven world. As a financial manager, being able to analyze and interpret large sets of financial data can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and forecasting. For instance, leveraging data analytics tools to identify trends in consumer behavior or financial markets can give a competitive edge to a business in making well-informed financial decisions.

Lastly, coding skills are becoming more of a necessity rather than just a desirable skill in the business world. With my own coding experience, I have found that having the ability to write and understand code opens up a world of possibilities for automating routine financial tasks, creating customized financial models, and integrating different software systems for seamless financial operations. Understanding coding languages like Python or SQL can greatly enhance a learner's versatility and efficiency in the workplace.

In conclusion, by acquiring skills in financial technology, data analytics, and coding, learners can position themselves as valuable assets in the business world, especially in finance-related roles. These digital areas not only align with the current trends in the industry but also offer opportunities for innovation and growth. As a financial manager with a background in accounting and coding, I have seen firsthand how these skills can make a significant difference in driving business success.

Moderator: **Interview with Physical Therapist**

Journalist: Thank you for joining me today. As a Physical Therapist, you have a unique perspective on the intersection of healthcare and technology. In your opinion, which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business?

Physical Therapist: Thank you for having me. I believe that learners should focus on acquiring skills in telehealth technologies, electronic health records (EHR), and wearable health devices. Telehealth technologies are becoming increasingly important in delivering remote healthcare services, especially in light of recent events. Understanding how to effectively communicate and provide care through digital platforms is crucial for healthcare professionals. Additionally, being proficient in EHR systems is essential for streamlining patient information and improving overall efficiency in healthcare settings. Lastly, with the rise of wearable health devices, learners should familiarize themselves with how to utilize and interpret data from these devices to provide personalized care.

Journalist: Those are certainly valuable skills to have in the healthcare industry today. How do you think the integration of these digital areas can improve patient outcomes and overall business performance in healthcare settings?

Physical Therapist: In the ever-evolving landscape of business, there are several digital skills that learners should acquire to stay competitive. From my experience as a Physical Therapist with a background in Kinesiology, I believe that having a solid understanding of data analytics would be beneficial for learners entering the business world today.

Data analytics is becoming increasingly vital in various industries, including healthcare. As a Physical Therapist, being able to analyze patient data and outcomes can help improve treatment plans and overall patient care. In a business context, data analytics can provide valuable insights for decision-making, marketing strategies, and understanding consumer behavior.

For example, understanding how to use software like Microsoft Excel or more advanced programs like Tableau can help learners analyze data sets to identify trends and make informed decisions. By being proficient in data analytics, learners can effectively communicate findings to stakeholders and drive meaningful change within an organization.

Additionally, basic knowledge of website development and digital marketing can also be advantageous for learners in today's business environment. Understanding how to create a website, optimize content for search engines, and leverage social media platforms for business purposes can help individuals stand out in the job market and contribute to the success of a business.

For instance, as a Physical Therapist looking to start a private practice, having a strong online presence through a website and social media can attract new patients and build brand awareness. By acquiring skills in website development and digital marketing, learners can effectively market themselves or their businesses in an increasingly digital world.

In conclusion, while my background may not be in coding or traditional business disciplines, I believe that skills in data analytics, website development, and digital marketing are valuable areas for learners to acquire today to be best suited for the business world. By developing proficiency in these digital areas, individuals can enhance their career prospects and make meaningful contributions to organizations in any field.

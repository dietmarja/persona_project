Digital marketing is essential for businesses to reach their target audience effectively in the digital space. Understanding concepts like search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, and online advertising can help learners promote their services and attract more clients.

Data analysis skills are also crucial for making informed business decisions. By learning how to collect, analyze, and interpret data, learners can gain valuable insights into their target market, make strategic decisions, and track the performance of their business.

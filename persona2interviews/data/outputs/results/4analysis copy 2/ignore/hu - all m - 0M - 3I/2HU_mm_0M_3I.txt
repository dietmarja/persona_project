**Moderator**: Good afternoon everyone. Today's question for discussion is: Which digital areas should learners acquire today to be best suited for business? Let's hear your thoughts.

**CTO of an AI Company**: I believe learners should prioritize acquiring skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technologies are transforming industries and businesses rapidly.

**President of a leading Computer Chip Company**: I agree with the CTO. In addition to AI and machine learning, learners should also focus on cybersecurity to protect businesses from evolving threats.

**Head of the Engineering Council in the UK**: I would add that learners should not overlook the importance of data analytics and the ability to derive insights from vast amounts of data to drive business decisions.

**Discussion Leader**: Building on that point, a solid foundation in cloud computing is essential as more businesses are transitioning to cloud-based services for scalability and flexibility.

**Leading editor of a major technological journal**: To succeed in the current business landscape, learners should also develop skills in digital marketing to reach and engage with target audiences effectively.

**Head of the School of Engineering at MIT (M)**: I believe learners should also focus on developing their skills in user experience design to create intuitive and user-friendly digital products and services.

**Maverick**: All these are important, but let's not forget the significance of blockchain technology. Learners who understand blockchain and its applications will have a competitive advantage in the future business ecosystem.

**Moderator**: Thank you for that provocative insight, Maverick. It's indeed important to consider emerging technologies like blockchain in preparing learners for the future of business.

**CTO of an AI Company**: I totally agree with the Maverick. Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize industries like finance, supply chain, and healthcare.

**President of a leading Computer Chip Company**: While blockchain is promising, learners should also focus on honing their skills in Internet of Things (IoT) as businesses are increasingly integrating connected devices into their operations.

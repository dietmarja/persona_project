Digital marketing plays a significant role in promoting events, reaching target audiences, and driving engagement. It allows for targeted advertising, personalized messaging, and real-time analytics that can help optimize marketing strategies.

In addition to digital marketing, learners should also acquire skills in social media management, content creation, data analytics, and search engine optimization (SEO).

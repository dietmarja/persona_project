    "response": "**Answer:**\nCondition 1: To run no coding AI as a programmer with medium knowledge level, you would need to research and select a user-friendly AI platform that offers a no-code solution, learn to navigate the interface, and understand the limitations and capabilities of the platform in order to effectively deploy AI models without coding.\n\nCondition 2: Running no coding AI as a programmer with medium knowledge level involves exploring different no-code AI tools, understanding their features and workflows, identifying the best tool that fits your needs, experimenting with the platform to grasp various functionalities such as data preprocessing, model training, and deployment, and continuously improving your understanding through practice and hands-on projects. Additionally, staying updated with industry trends and best practices in AI will also be helpful"
